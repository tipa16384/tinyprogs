Goal accomplished!</li>\n<li>I did scoot around in\xa0<strong>Guild Wars 2</strong> for a couple weeks &#8212; it was nice, it was fun, but it wasn&#8217;t sticky at all. Nice to visit with my Ranger, though. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be playing the expansion later this month.</li>\n<li>There was some <strong>WoW Classic</strong> adventures earlier this month, but those got shelved again as I keep waiting for Burning Crusade&#8217;s pre-patch.</li>\n<li>In non-MMOs, I hit infinite in\xa0<strong>Marvel Snap</strong> for the second time ever and sank a lot of hours into\xa0<strong>Rimworld</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href="https://biobreak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sunset.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-65017" height="410" src="https://biobreak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sunset.jpg" width="700" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>October gaming goals</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I&#8217;ve been working on a list of some CRPGs and JRPGs I&#8217;d like to play, but I haven&#8217;t decided which, if any, I might commit to this month. I wish I had the funds to buy The Outer Worlds 2 right now, but that&#8217;s going to have to wait. Also on my &#8220;to buy in the near future&#8221; list is Erenshor, Chained Echoes, and the Rimworld Odyssey expansion.</li>\n<li>In\xa0<strong>LOTRO</strong>, I&#8217;m going to keep on keeping on with my Captain (in Outer Gondor) and Mariner (in Lothlorien/Mirkwood), doing all the quests and deeds in each before moving to the next place. We&#8217;ve got a while before the expansion hits in December (or perhaps later), so this will be the course this fall.</li>\n<li>In\xa0<strong>WoW</strong>, it&#8217;s all going to be about Legion Remix! I&#8217;ll probably roll up a Shaman or Druid (mayyyyybe Hunter) to comb through that entire expansion and unlock as much stuff as I possibly can.</li>\n<li>There&#8217;s not a lot else that&#8217;s beating down my door right now as must-play.

The Galeshot spec looks pretty cool, but that&#8217;s for a later date if and when I buy the expansion. I think I&#8217;m about three unpurchased expansions behind with WoW and LOTRO expansion purchases looming soon, so I&#8217;m not going to rush that decision.</p>\n<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-64860" height="394" src="https://biobreak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ice.jpg" width="700" /></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also not going to rush any particular goal. There&#8217;s certainly plenty to do &#8212; 30% more map completion, daily wizard&#8217;s vault tasks, getting mounts, getting a house, and going through most of the expansions. For now, I decided to complete Frostgorge Sound, doing some event chains as they popped up and easing back into the game.</p>\n<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-64870" height="372" src="https://biobreak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ice-1.jpg" width="700" /></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s actually been very relaxing and enjoyable. I&#8217;m not pushing it, but rather attempting to ease into this gameplay once more. Again, the pick of the Ranger really helped to simplify combat, and since I have auto-loot going, I don&#8217;t even have to worry about running around hoovering up corpses. If there&#8217;s an event in the area, or one that&#8217;s broadcast, I&#8217;ve been up for doing those, but right now it&#8217;s mostly been mapping the old world.</p>\n<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-64880" height="394" src="https://biobreak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fireheart.jpg" width="700" /></p>\n<p>Guild Wars 2 definitely bought into that older style of MMO zone design, which is that high-level zones had to be ugly and foreboding. Lots of fire, ash, death, volcanoes, etc. It makes for some lackluster mapping, such as through Fireheart Rise.</p>\n<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-64883" height="446" src="https://biobreak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fly.jpg" width="700" /></p>\n<p>It is nice to have 10 outfits, a cool glider skin, and at least the first two basic mounts. Other than a flying mount, there&#8217;s nothing that I feel I truly *need* right now to experience the game and tear through these maps. I don&#8217;t have any elite specs going on her, but that&#8217;s fine &#8212; I&#8217;m just collecting hero points to give myself the future choice of one.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://biobreak.wordpress.com/2025/09/17/guild-wars-2-ranging-into-tyria/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/836ca23089c8b5bceed0338d9104bf161b5d9aa8a728d9318701ab6af13a8b9a?s=96&d=https%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fmu.gif&r=PG', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://biobreak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ranger.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://biobreak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ice.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://biobreak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ice-1.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://biobreak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fireheart.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://biobreak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fly.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}]}

[...] not a dream of motor cars and high wages merely, but a dream of social order in which [everyone] shall be able to attain to the fullest stature of which they are innately capable, and be recognized by others for what they are, regardless of the fortuitous circumstances of birth or position&#x201d;</blockquote><p>I wanted to know what these words meant to us today. I needed to know what parts of the American Dream we all still had in common. I had to make some sense of what was happening to our country. I&#x2019;ve been writing on my blog since 2004, and on November 7th, I started writing the most difficult piece I have ever written. </p><p>I asked so many Americans to tell me what the American Dream personally meant to them, and I wrote it all down.</p><p>Later in November, I attended a theater performance of The Outsiders at my son&#x2019;s public high school &#x2013; an adaptation of <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_(novel)&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1742507328643679&amp;usg=AOvVaw2GgwTbUV3qWhPvsHuYFgy7" rel="noreferrer">the 1967 novel by S.E. Hinton</a>. All I really knew was the famous &#x201c;stay gold&#x201d; line from the 1983 movie. But as I sat there in the audience among my neighbors, watching the complete story acted out in front of me by these teenagers, I slowly realized what &#x201c;stay gold&#x201d; meant: <em>sharing the American Dream.</em></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income" class="kg-image" height="2894" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/IMG_7003.jpg" width="2000" /></figure><p>We cannot merely attain the Dream. The dream is incomplete until we share it with our fellow Americans. That act of sharing is the final realization of everything the dream stands for.</p><p>Thanks to S.E. Hinton, I finally had a name for my essay, <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/stay-gold-america/" rel="noreferrer">&#x201c;Stay Gold, America.&#x201d;</a> I published it on January 7th, with a <strong>Pledge to Share the American Dream</strong>.</p><p>In the first part of the Pledge, the short term, our family made eight 1 million dollar donations to the following nonprofit groups: <a href="https://teamrubiconusa.org/" rel="noreferrer">Team Rubicon</a>, <a href="https://childrenshungerfund.org/" rel="noreferrer">Children&#x2019;s Hunger Fund</a>, <a href="https://pen.org/">PEN America</a>, <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/" rel="noreferrer">The Trevor Project</a>, <a href="https://www.naacpldf.org/" rel="noreferrer">NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund</a>, <a href="https://www.firstgenerationinvestors.com/" rel="noreferrer">First Generation Investors</a>, <a href="https://www.globalrefuge.org/" rel="noreferrer">Global Refuge</a>, and <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/" rel="noreferrer">Planned Parenthood</a>. </p><p>Beyond that, we made many additional one million dollar donations to reinforce our technical infrastructure in America &#x2013; <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" rel="noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://archive.org" rel="noreferrer">The Internet Archive</a>, <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/" rel="noreferrer">The Common Crawl Foundation</a>, <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" rel="noreferrer">Let&#x2019;s Encrypt</a>, pioneering independent internet journalism, and several other crucial open source software infrastructure projects that power much of the world today.</p><p>I encourage every American to <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/" rel="noreferrer">contribute soon</a>, however you can, to organizations you feel are effectively helping those most currently in need.</p><p>But short term fixes are not enough.</p><p>The <strong>Pledge To Share The American Dream</strong> requires a much more ambitious second act &#x2013; deeper, long term changes that will take decades. Over the next five years, my family pledges half our remaining wealth to plant a seed toward foundational long term efforts ensuring that all Americans continue to have the same fair access to the American Dream.</p><p>Let me tell you about my own path to the American Dream. It was rocky. My parents were born into deep poverty in Mercer County, West Virginia, and Beaufort County, North Carolina. Our family eventually clawed our way to the bottom of the middle class in Virginia. </p><p>I won&#x2019;t dwell on it, but every family has their own problems. We did not remain middle class for long. But through all this, my parents got the most important thing right: they loved me openly and unconditionally. That is everything. It&#x2019;s the only reason I am standing here in front of you today.</p><p>With my family&#x2019;s support, I managed to achieve a solid public education in Chesterfield County, Virginia, and had the incredible privilege of an affordable state education at the <a href="https://www.virginia.edu/aboutuva/" rel="noreferrer">University of Virginia</a>. This is a college uniquely rooted in the beliefs of one of the most prominent Founding Fathers, Thomas Jefferson. He was a living paradox. A man of profound ideals and yet flawed &#x2013; trapped in the values of his time and place. </p><p>Still, he wrote &#x201c;Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&#x201d; at the top of the Declaration of Independence. These words were, and still are, revolutionary. They define our fundamental shared American values, although we have not always lived up to them. The American Dream isn&#x2019;t about us succeeding, alone, by ourselves, but about connecting with each other and succeeding together as Americans.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve been concerned about wealth concentration in America ever since I watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM" rel="noreferrer">2012 video by politizane</a> illustrating just how extreme wealth concentration already was. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>I had no idea how close we were to the American Gilded Age from the late 1800s. This period was given a name in the 1920s by historians referencing Mark Twain&#x2019;s 1873 novel, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gilded_Age:_A_Tale_of_Today" rel="noreferrer">The Gilded Age, A Tale of Today</a>. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income" class="kg-image" height="800" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-151.png" width="1200" /></figure><p>During this time, labor strikes often turned violent, with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestead_strike" rel="noreferrer">Homestead Strike of 1892</a> resulting in deadly confrontations between workers and Pinkerton guards hired by factory owners. Rapid industrialization created hazardous working conditions in factories, mines, and railroads, where thousands died due to insufficient safety regulations and employers who prioritized profit over worker welfare.</p><p>In January 2025, while I was still writing <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/stay-gold-america/" rel="noreferrer">&#x201c;Stay Gold, America&#x201d;</a>, we entered the period of greatest wealth concentration in the entirety of American history. As of 2021, the <a href="https://usafacts.org/articles/how-this-chart-explains-americans-wealth-across-income-levels/" rel="noreferrer">top 1% of households controlled 32% of all wealth</a>, while the bottom 50% only have 2.6%. It&#x2019;s difficult to find more recent data, but wealth concentration has only intensified in the last four years.</p><p>We can no longer say &#x201c;Gilded Age.&#x201d;</p><p>We must now say &#x201c;The First Gilded Age.&#x201d;</p><p>Today, in our <em>second</em> Gilded Age, more and more people find their path to the American Dream blocked. When Americans face unaffordable education, lack of accessible healthcare, or lack affordable housing, they aren&#x2019;t just disadvantaged &#x2013; they&#x2019;re trapped, often burdened by massive debt. They have no stable foundation to build their lives. They watch desperately, working as hard as they can, while life simply passes them by, without even the freedom to choose their own lives.</p><p>They don&#x2019;t have time to build a career. They don&#x2019;t have time to learn, to improve. They don&#x2019;t get to start a business. They can&#x2019;t choose where their kids will grow up, or whether to have children at all, because they can&#x2019;t afford to. Here in the land of opportunity, the pursuit of happiness has become an endless task for too many. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income" class="kg-image" height="1141" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-152.png" width="1178" /></figure><p>We are denying people any real chance of achieving the dream that we promised them &#x2013; that we promised the entire world &#x2013; when we founded this nation. It is such a profound betrayal of everything we ever dreamed about. Without a stable foundation to build a life on, our fellow Americans cannot even <em>pursue</em> the American Dream, much less achieve it.</p><p>I ask you this: as an American, what is the purpose of a dream left unshared with so many for so long? What&#x2019;s happening to our dream? Are we really willing to let go of our values so easily? We&#x2019;re Americans. We fight for our values, the values embodied in our dream, the ones we founded this country on. </p><p>Why aren&#x2019;t we sharing the American Dream? </p><p>Why aren&#x2019;t we giving everyone a fair chance at Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness by providing them the fundamentals they need to get there?</p><p>The Dream worked for me, decades ago, and I deeply believe that the American Dream can still work for everyone &#x2013; if we ensure every American has the same fair chance we did. The American Dream was never about a few people being extraordinarily wealthy. It&#x2019;s about everyone having an equal chance to succeed and pursue their dreams &#x2013; their own happiness. It belongs to them. I think we owe them at least that. I think we owe <em>ourselves</em> at least that.</p><p>What can we do about this? There are no easy answers. I can&#x2019;t even pretend to have the answer, because there isn&#x2019;t any one answer to give. Nothing worth doing is ever that simple. But I can tell you this: all the studies and all the data I&#x2019;ve looked at have strongly pointed to one foundational thing we can do here in America over the next five years.</p><p>Natalie Foster, co-founder of the <a href="https://economicsecurityproject.org/" rel="noreferrer">Economic Security Project</a>, makes a powerful case for the idea that, with all this concentrated wealth, we can offer a <strong>Guaranteed Minimum Income</strong> in the poorest areas of this country &#x2013; the areas of most need, where money goes the farthest &#x2013; to unlock vast amounts of untapped American potential. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1620978466/"><img alt="The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income" class="kg-image" height="700" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/the-guarantee-book-natalie-foster-1.jpg" width="467" /></a></figure><p>This isn&#x2019;t a new idea. We&#x2019;ve been doing this a while now in different forms, but we never called it Guaranteed Minimum Income.</p><p>In <strong>1797</strong>, Thomas Paine proposed a retirement pension funded by estate taxes. It didn&#x2019;t go anywhere, but it planted a seed. Much later we implemented the Social Security Act in <strong>1935</strong> . The economic chaos of the Great Depression coupled with the inability of private philanthropy to provide economic security inspired Franklin Roosevelt&#x2019;s New Deal government programs. The most popular and effective program to emerge from this era was Social Security, providing a guaranteed income for retirees. Before Social Security, <em>half</em> of seniors lived in poverty. Today only 10% of seniors live in poverty.</p><p>In his <strong>1967</strong> book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_Do_We_Go_from_Here:_Chaos_or_Community%3F" rel="noreferrer">Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community</a>, Martin Luther King Jr made the moral case for a form of UBI, Universal Basic Income. King believed that economic insecurity was at the root of all inequality. He stated that a guaranteed income &#x2014; direct cash disbursements &#x2014; was the simplest and best way to fight poverty.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income" class="kg-image" height="1401" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-147.png" width="1920" /></figure><p>In <strong>1972</strong>, Congress established the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, providing direct cash assistance to low-income elderly, blind, and disabled individuals with little or no income. This cash can be used for food, housing, and medical expenses, the essentials for financial stability. As of January, 2025, over 7.3 million people receive SSI benefits.</p><p>In <strong>1975</strong>, Congress passed the Tax Reduction Act, establishing the Earned Income Tax Credit. This tax credit benefits working-class parents with children, encouraging work by increasing the income of low-income workers. In 2023, it lifted about 6.4 million people out of poverty, including 3.4 million children. <a href="https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/2024/demo/p60-283.pdf" rel="noreferrer">According to the Census Bureau</a>, it is the second most effective anti-poverty tool after Social Security.</p><p>In <strong>2019</strong>, directly inspired by King, mayor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Tubbs" rel="noreferrer">Michael Tubbs</a> &#x2013; at age 26, one of the youngest mayors in American history &#x2013; launched the $3 million <a href="https://www.stocktondemonstration.org/" rel="noreferrer">Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration</a>. It provided 125 residents with $500 per month in unconditional cash payments for two years.

Our proposal to ensure access to the American Dream is to follow the path less travelled by:  <strong>Guaranteed Minimum Income. </strong>GMI is a simpler, more practical, more scalable plan to directly address the root of economic insecurity with minimum bureaucracy.</p><p>We are partnering with GiveDirectly, who oversaw <a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/united-states/" rel="noreferrer">the most GMI studies</a> in the United States, and OpenResearch, who just completed the <a href="https://www.openresearchlab.org/studies/unconditional-cash-study/study" rel="noreferrer">largest, most detailed GMI study</a> ever conducted in this country in 2023. We are working together to launch a new Guaranteed Minimum Income initiative in <strong>rural American communities</strong>.</p><p>Network effects within communities explain why equality of opportunity is so effective, and why a shared American Dream is the most powerful dream of all. The potential of the American Dream becomes vastly greater as more people have access to it, <strong>because<em> they share it</em><em>.</em></strong></p><p>They share it with their families, their friends, and their neighbors. The groundbreaking, massive <a href="https://www.openresearchlab.org/studies/unconditional-cash-study/documentation" rel="noreferrer">2023 OpenResearch UBI study data</a> showed that when you give money to the poorest among us, they consistently go <em>out</em> <em>of their way</em> to share that money with others in desperate need.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><a href="https://www.openresearchlab.org/studies/unconditional-cash-study/documentation"><img alt="The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income" class="kg-image" height="966" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/openresearch-ubi-study-expenditures.png" width="1719" /></a></figure><p>The power of opportunity is not in what it can do for one person, but how it connects and strengthens bonds between people. When you empower a couple, you allow them to build a family. When you empower families, you allow them to build a community. When you guarantee fundamentals, you&#x2019;re providing a foundation for those connections to grow and thrive. This is the incredible power and value of community. That is what we are investing in &#x2013; each other.</p><p>A system where there are no guarantees creates conflict. It creates inequality. A massive concentration of wealth in so few hands weakens connections between us and prevents new ones. America began as a place of connection. Millions of us came together to build this nation, not individually, but together. Equality is connection, and connection is more valuable than any product any company will ever sell you.</p><p>Why focus on rural communities? There are consistently higher poverty rates in rural counties, with fewer job opportunities, lower wages, and worse access to healthcare and education. It&#x2019;s not a new problem, either &#x2014; places like Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta, and American Indian reservations have been stuck in poverty for decades, with some counties like Oglala Lakota, SD (55.8%) and McDowell, WV (37.6%) hitting extreme levels. Meanwhile, urban counties rarely see numbers that high. The data from the US Census and USDA Economic Research Service make it clear: if you&#x2019;re poor in America, being rural makes it even harder to escape.</p><p>Rural areas also offer smaller populations, which is helpful because we need to start small with lots of tightly controlled studies that we can carefully scale and improve on for larger areas. We hope to build a large body of scientific data showing that GMI really does improve the lives, and the communities, of our fellow Americans.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income" class="kg-image" height="1067" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-149.png" width="1600" /></figure><h3 id="the-initial-plan-is-to-target-a-few-counties-that-i-have-a-personal-connection-to-and-are-still-currently-in-poverty-decades-later">The initial plan is to target a few counties that I have a personal connection to, and are still currently in poverty, decades later:</h3><ul><li>My father was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercer_County,_West_Virginia" rel="noreferrer">Mercer County</a>, West Virginia, where the collapse of coal mining left good people struggling to survive. Their living and their way of life is now all but gone, and good jobs are hard to find.</li><li>My mother&#x2019;s birthplace, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaufort_County,_North_Carolina" rel="noreferrer">Beaufort County</a>, North Carolina, has been hit just as hard, with farming and factory jobs disappearing and families left wondering what&#x2019;s next.</li><li>Our third county is yet to be decided, but will be a community also facing the same systemic, generational obstacles to economic stability and achieving the American Dream.</li></ul><p>We will work with existing local groups to coordinate GMI studies where community members choose to enroll. We will conduct outreach and and provide mentorship to these opt-in study participants. It will be teamwork between Americans.</p><p>We hope Veterans will play a crucial role in our effort. We plan to work with local communities and veteran-serving organizations to engage veterans to support and execute our GMI programs &#x2013; the same veterans who served our country with distinction, returning home with exceptional leadership skills and a deep commitment to their communities. Their involvement ensures these programs reflect core American values of self-reliance and community service to fellow Americans. </p><p>We&#x2019;ll also partner with established community organizations &#x2014; churches, civic groups, community colleges, local businesses. These partnerships help integrate our GMI studies with existing support systems, rather than creating new ones.</p><p><a href="https://givedirectly.org/" rel="noreferrer">GiveDirectly</a> and <a href="https://www.openresearchlab.org/studies/unconditional-cash-study/study" rel="noreferrer">OpenResearch</a> will build on their existing body of work, gathering extensive data from these refined studies. We&#x2019;ll measure employment, entrepreneurship, education, health, and community engagement. We&#x2019;ll conduct regular interviews with participants to understand their experience. How is this working for you? How can we make it better? You tell us. How can we make it better together?</p><p>Economic security isn&#x2019;t only about individual well-being &#x2013; it&#x2019;s the bedrock of democracy. When people aren&#x2019;t constantly worried about feeding themselves, feeding their family, having decent healthcare, having a place to live&#x2026; we have given them room to breathe. We have given them freedom. The freedom to raise their children, the freedom to start businesses, the freedom to choose where they work, the freedom to volunteer... the freedom to <em>vote</em>.</p><p>This isn&#x2019;t about ideology or government. It&#x2019;s about us, as Americans, working together to invest in our future &#x2013; possibly the greatest unlocking of human potential in our entire history. I do not say these things lightly. I&#x2019;ve seen it work. I&#x2019;ve looked at all the existing study data. A little bit of money is incredibly transformational for people in poverty &#x2013; the people who need it the most &#x2013; the people who cannot live up to their potential because they&#x2019;re so busy simply trying to survive. Imagine what they could do if we gave them just a little breathing room.</p><p>GMI is a long term investment in the future of what America should be, the way we wrote it down in the Declaration of Independence, perhaps incompletely &#x2013; but our democracy was always meant to be malleable, to change, to adapt, and improve.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income" class="kg-image" height="800" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-148.png" width="1200" /></figure><p>I&#x2019;d like to conclude by mentioning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz" rel="noreferrer">Aaron Swartz</a>. He was a precocious teenage programmer much like myself. Aaron helped develop RSS web feeds, co-founded Reddit, and worked with Creative Commons to create flexible copyright licenses for the common good. He used technology to make information universally accessible to everyone.</p><p>Aaron created a system to download public domain court documents from PACER, a government database that charged fees for accessing what he believed should be freely available public information. A few years later, while visiting MIT under their open campus policy and as a research fellow at Harvard, he used MIT&#x2019;s network to download millions of academic articles from JSTOR, another fee-charging online academic journal repository, intending to make this knowledge freely accessible. Since taxpayers had funded much of this research, why shouldn&#x2019;t that knowledge be freely available to everyone?</p><p>What Aaron saw as an act of academic freedom and information equality, authorities viewed as a crime&#x2014;he was arrested in January 2011 and charged with multiple felonies for what many considered to be nothing more than accessing knowledge that should have been freely available to the public in the first place.</p><p>Despite JSTOR declining to pursue charges and MIT eventually calling for leniency, federal prosecutors aggressively pursued felony charges against Aaron with up to 35 years in prison. Facing overwhelming legal pressure and the prospect of being labeled a felon, Aaron took his own life at 26. This sparked widespread criticism of prosecutorial overreach and prompted discussions about open access to information. Deservedly so. Eight days later, in this very hall, there was a standing room only memorial service praising Aaron for his commitment to the public good.</p><p>Aaron pursued what was right for we, the people. He chose to build the public good despite knowing there would be risks. He chose to be an activist. I think we should all choose to be activists, to be brave, to stand up for our defining American principles. </p><h2 id="there-are-two-things-i-ask-of-you-today">There are two things I ask of you today.</h2><ol><li>Visit <a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/rural-us/">givedirectly.org/rural-us</a> where we&#x2019;ll be documenting our journey and findings from the initial three GMI rural county studies. Let&#x2019;s find out together how guaranteed minimum income can transform American lives.</li><li>Talk about <strong>Guaranteed Minimum Income</strong> in your communities. Meet with your state and local officials. Share the existing study data. Share outcomes. Ask them about conducting GMI studies like ours in your area. We tell ourselves stories about why some people succeed and others don&#x2019;t. Challenge those stories. Economic security is not <em>charity</em>. It is an <em>investment</em> in vast untapped American potential in the poorest areas of this country.</li></ol><p>My family is committing 50 million dollars to this endeavor, but imagine if we had even more to share. Imagine how much more we could do, if we build this together, starting today. Decades from now, people will look back and wonder why it took us so long to share our dream of a better, richer, and fuller life with our fellow Americans.</p><p>I hope you join us on this grand experiment to share our American Dream. I believe everyone deserves a fair chance at what was promised when we founded this nation: Life, Liberty, and <em>the pursuit of The American Dream.</em></p>'}]}

But staying gold isn&#x2019;t passive. It takes work. It takes action. It takes hard conversations that ask us to confront where we&#x2019;ve been, where we are, and who we want to be.</p><p>That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m incredibly honored to be joining <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Vindman" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Alexander Vindman</strong></a> in giving a talk at the historic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Union" rel="noreferrer">Cooper Union Great Hall</a> 14 days from now. I greatly admire the way Colonel Vindman was willing to put everything on the line to defend the ideals of democracy and the American Dream.</p><p>The American Dream is, at its core, the promise that hard work, fairness, and opportunity can lead to a better future. But in 2025, that promise feels like a question: <strong>How can we build on our dream so that it works for everyone?</strong></p><p>Alexander and I will explore this in our joint talk through the lens of democracy, community, and economic mobility. We come from very different backgrounds, but we strongly share the belief that everyone&apos;s American Dream is worth fighting for.</p><p>Alexander Vindman has lived many lifetimes of standing up for what&apos;s right. He was born in the Soviet Union and immigrated to the U.S. as a child, growing up in Brooklyn before enlisting in the U.S. Army. Over the next 21 years, he served with distinction, earning a Purple Heart for injuries sustained in Iraq and eventually rising to Director of European Affairs for the National Security Council. When asked to choose between looking the other way or upholding the values he swore to protect, he chose correctly. That decision cost him his career but never his integrity. I have a lot to learn about what civic duty truly means from Alex.</p><p>I build things on the Internet, like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" rel="noreferrer">Stack Overflow</a> and <a href="https://discourse.org/" rel="noreferrer">Discourse</a>. I write on the internet, on this blog. I&apos;ve spent years thinking about how people interact online, how communities work (or don&apos;t), and how we create digital spaces that encourage fairness, participation, and constructive discourse. Spaces that result in artifacts for the common good, like local parks, where everyone can enjoy them together. Whether you&apos;re running a country or running a forum, the same rules seem to apply: people need clear expectations, fair systems, strong boundaries, and a shared sense of purpose. </p><p>This is the part of <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/stay-gold-america/" rel="noreferrer">Stay Gold</a> I couldn&apos;t tell you about, not yet, because I was working so hard to figure it out. How do you make long-term structural change that creates opportunity for everyone? It is an incredibly complex problem. But if we focus our efforts in a particular area, I believe we can change a lot of things in this country. Maybe not everything, but something foundational to the next part of our history as a country: <strong>how to move beyond individual generosity and toward systems that create security, dignity, and possibility for all</strong>.</p><p>I can&apos;t promise easy answers, but what I can promise is an honest, unfiltered conversation about how we move forward, with specifics. Colonel Vindman brings the perspective of someone who embodied American ideals, and I bring the experience of building self-governing digital communities that scale, which turned out to be far more relevant to the future of democracy than I ever would have dreamed possible.</p><p>Imagine what we can do if Alex and I work together. Imagine what we could do if we <em>all worked together</em>.</p><p>This event was streamed in real time via the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-WfLn9ekLD9_-nL0zIyneXNKvii8r0MW" rel="noreferrer">Cooper Union Great Hall YouTube channel</a>:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure>'}]}

My parents are of hardscrabble rural West Virginia and rural North Carolina origins. They barely managed to claw their way to the bottom of the middle class by the time they ended up in Virginia. Unfortunately, due to the demons passed on to them by their parents, my father was an alcoholic and my mother participated in the drinking. She ended up divorcing my father when I was 16 years old. It was only after the divorce that my parents were able to heal themselves, heal their only child, and stop the drinking, which was so destructive to our family. If the divorce hadn&#x2019;t forced the issue, alcohol would have inevitably destroyed us all. <br /><br />My parents may not have done everything right, but they both unconditionally loved me. <strong>They taught me how to fully, deeply receive love, and the profound joy of reflecting that love upon everyone around you. </strong></p><p>I went on to attend public school in Chesterfield County, Virginia. In 1992 I graduated from the University of Virginia, founded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>.</p><p>During college, I worked at Safeway as a part-time cashier, earning the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/minimum-wage/history" rel="noreferrer">federal minimum wage</a>, scraping together whatever money I could through government Pell grants, scholarships, and other part-time work to pay my college tuition. Even with <a href="https://www.salliemae.com/blog/in-state-vs-out-of-state-tuition/" rel="noreferrer">lower in-state tuition</a>, it was rocky. Sometimes I could barely manage tuition payments. And that was in 1992, when tuition was only $3,000 per year.

All I really knew was the famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f46JMzVzSB4" rel="noreferrer">&#x201c;stay gold&#x201d; line</a> from the 1983 movie adaptation. But as I sat there in the audience among my neighbors, watching the complete story acted out in front of me by these teenagers, I slowly realized what staying gold actually meant: <a href="http://blog.asjournal.org/the-american-dream-reconsidered-the-outsiders-1967/" rel="noreferrer"><em>sharing</em> the American Dream</a>. </p><p>In the printed program, the director wrote:</p><blockquote>This play is a reminder that strength lies not just in overcoming hardships but in staying true to ourselves and lifting up those around us. <br /><br />We hope you feel the raw emotions, sense the camaraderie, and <strong>connect with the enduring themes of resilience, empathy, and unity</strong>. Whether you&#x2019;ve read this story recently, long ago, or not at all, I hope you are able to find inspiration in the strength and passion of youth. Thank you for being part of this journey with us.<br /><br /><a href="https://poets.org/poem/nothing-gold-can-stay"><strong>Stay gold</strong></a><strong>.</strong></blockquote><p>I <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/im-loyal-to-nothing-except-the-dream/" rel="noreferrer">believe deeply</a> in sharing The American Dream. It is the foundation of our country, the second paragraph in our <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript" rel="noreferrer">Declaration of Independence</a>, written by the founder of the public university I attended:</p><blockquote>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</blockquote><p>But the American Dream is not always available to every American. Its meaning can be distorted. Jimi Hendrix <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/rewinding-jimi-hendrixs-national-anthem" rel="noreferrer">captured this distortion</a> so eloquently in his rendition of our national anthem. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>We are still trying to live up to those ideals today.

Whatever the reasons, 42% of adults living in America had no say in the 2024 election. The vote <a href="https://election.lab.ufl.edu/2024-general-election-turnout/" rel="noreferrer">failed to represent everyone</a>.</p><p>I think many of the Americans who did vote are telling us they no longer believe our government is effectively <em>keeping America fair for everyone</em>. Our status as the <a href="https://thefulcrum.us/ethics-leadership/democracy-index" rel="noreferrer">world&#x2019;s leading democracy</a> is in question. We should make it easier for more eligible Americans to vote, such as <strong>making election day a </strong><a href="https://www.actforamerica.org/act-now/Make-Election-Day-a-National-Holiday" rel="noreferrer"><strong>national holiday</strong></a><strong>, universal </strong><a href="https://tracker.votingrightslab.org/issues/universal-mailed-ballots#issues_map" rel="noreferrer"><strong>mail in voting</strong></a><strong>, and adopting </strong><a href="https://fairvote.org/our-reforms/ranked-choice-voting/" rel="noreferrer"><strong>ranked choice voting</strong></a> so all votes carry more weight. We should also strengthen institutions keeping democracy fair for everyone, such as state and local election boards, as well as the Federal Election Commission.<br /><br />It was only after I attained the dream that I was able to fully see how many Americans have so very little. This much wealth starts to unintentionally distance my family from other Americans. I no longer bother to look at how much items cost, because <em>I don&#x2019;t have to</em>. We don&#x2019;t have to think about all these things that are challenging or unreachable for so many others. The more wealth you attain, the more unmistakably clear it becomes how unequal life is for so many of us.<br /><br />Even with the wealth I have, I can&#x2019;t imagine what it would feel like <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/11/democrats-harris-billionaire-mistake/680779/" rel="noreferrer">to be a billionaire</a><em>.</em> <strong>It is, for lack of a better word, </strong><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/01/09/trends-in-income-and-wealth-inequality/" rel="noreferrer"><strong>unamerican</strong></a><strong>. </strong></p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>In 2012, the top 1% of Americans held 24% of our country&#x2019;s wealth. By 2021, the top 1% of Americans held 30%.  So many have so little, while a tiny few have massive, wildly disproportionate wealth, which keeps growing. Now the global top 1% hold nearly <a href="https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/richest-1-bag-nearly-twice-much-wealth-rest-world-put-together-over-past-two-years" rel="noreferrer">twice as much wealth</a> as the rest of the world combined.<br /><br />I grew up poor in America, inspired by the promise of the American Dream that I could better myself and my family by building things that <em>mattered</em>:</p><blockquote>Work is service, not gain. The object of work is life, not income. The reward of production is plenty, not private fortune. We should measure the prosperity of a nation not by the number of millionaires, but by<strong> the absence of poverty, the prevalence of health, the efficiency of the public schools, </strong>and the number of people who can and do read worthwhile books<strong>. </strong>&#x2013; <a href="https://credo.library.umass.edu/view/full/mums312-b203-i031" rel="noreferrer">Du Bois</a></blockquote><p>Our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism#Types" rel="noreferrer">version of capitalism</a> delivered so much wealth to my family for my hard work in co-founding two successful companies. My partner and I gladly paid our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_States" rel="noreferrer">full taxes</a>, and we always planned to give most of our remaining wealth to charities when we pass, following the <a href="https://givingpledge.org/pledger?pledgerId=177" rel="noreferrer">Warren Buffett Philanthropic Pledge</a>:</p><blockquote>More than 99% of my wealth will go to philanthropy during my lifetime or at death.</blockquote><p>I admire Buffett, but even having only a tiny fraction of his $325 billion fortune, to me this pledge was incomplete. When would this wealth be transferred? </p><p>Last year he <a href="https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2024/06/28/investing/warren-buffett-gates-donation" rel="noreferrer">amended the pledge</a>, giving all his wealth at death to a charitable trust run by his children, aged 71, 69, and 66, who <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/01/warren-buffett-pledge-100-billion" rel="noreferrer">do not make for natural charitable bedfellows</a>. I am only holding back enough wealth for my children so they can afford college educations and buy a home. I am compelled to, because being a parent is <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/on-parenthood/" rel="noreferrer">the toughest job I&#x2019;ve ever had</a>, and I am concerned about their future.</p><p>November 5th <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election" rel="noreferrer">raised the stakes</a>. It is now time to allocate <strong>half the wealth</strong> I was so fortunate to be dealt within the next five years<strong>,</strong> not just for my own family, but for all my fellow Americans. </p><p>Our government seems to be slower and slower at delivering change due to the increased <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/09/polarization-democracy-and-political-violence-in-the-united-states-what-the-research-says?lang=en" rel="noreferrer">polarization of our two party system</a>.

In an informal conversation, Fermi noted no convincing evidence of this, nor any signs of alien intelligence anywhere in the observable universe, leading him to ask, &#x201c;Where is everybody?&#x201d;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n<p>To me, this is a compelling argument, in the same way that&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel?ref=codinghorror.obox.agency#Absence_of_time_travelers_from_the_future" rel="noopener noreferrer">the lack of evidence of any time travellers</a>&#xa0;is:</p><blockquote>Many have argued that the absence of time travelers from the future demonstrates that such technology will never be developed, suggesting that it is impossible. This is analogous to the Fermi paradox related to the absence of evidence of extraterrestrial life. As the absence of extraterrestrial visitors does not categorically prove they do not exist, so the absence of time travelers fails to prove time travel is physically impossible; it might be that time travel is physically possible but is never developed or is cautiously used. Carl Sagan once suggested the possibility that time travelers could be here but are disguising their existence or are not recognized as time travelers.</blockquote><p>It seems, to me at least, clear evidence that time travel is not possible, given the enormous amount of time behind us.

Small spaces, small units of time, <strong>everything gets smaller</strong>.</blockquote><p>Large is inefficient and unnecessary. Look at the history of computers: from giant to tiny and tinier. From slow to fast and faster.

It may be &#x2013; and this is, of course, speculation &#x2013; that advanced societies are building small technology and have little incentive or need to rearrange the stars in their neighborhoods, for instance.

There&#x2019;s a lot going on right now. It&#x2019;s a busy time. But let&#x2019;s pause and take a moment to celebrate that Elon Musk destroyed Twitter. I can&#x2019;t possibly <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/god-did-us-a-favor-by-destroying-twitter/" rel="noreferrer">say it better than Paul Ford</a>, so I&#x2019;ll just refer you there:</p><blockquote>Every five or six minutes, someone in the social sciences publishes a PDF with a title like &#x201c;Humans 95 Percent Happier in Small Towns, Waving at Neighbors and Eating Sandwiches.&#x201d; When we gather in groups of more than, say, eight, it&#x2019;s a disaster. Yet there is something fundamental in our nature that desperately wants to get everyone together in one big room, to &#x201c;solve it.&#x201d; Our smarter, richer betters (in Babel times, the king&#x2019;s name was Nimrod) often preach the idea of a town square, a marketplace of ideas, a centralized hub of discourse and entertainment &#x2013; and we listen. But when I go back and read Genesis, I hear God saying: &#x201c;My children, I designed your brains to scale to 150 stable relationships. Anything beyond that is overclocking. You should all try Mastodon.&#x201d;</blockquote><p>It&#x2019;s been clear for quite some time that the early social media strategery of &#x201c;jam a million people in a colosseum and let them fight it out with free speech&#x201d; isn&#x2019;t panning out, but never has it been more clear than now, under the Elon Musk regime, that being beholden to the whims of a <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/elon-musk-isnt-funny-bad-jokes-twitter-1234712950/" rel="noreferrer">billionaire going through a midlife crisis</a> isn&#x2019;t exactly healthy for society. Or you. Or me. Or anyone, really.</p><p>I tried to be fair; I gave the post-Elon Twitter era a week, thinking &#x201c;how bad could it possibly be?&#x201d; and good lord, <em>it was so much worse than I could have possibly ever imagined</em>. It&#x2019;s like Elon read the Dilbert pointy-haired-manager book on management and bonked his head on every rung of the ladder going down, generating an ever-growing laundry <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/04/elon-musk-twitter-terrible-things-hes-said-and-done" rel="noreferrer">list of terrible things</a> no manager should ever do. And he <em>kept going!</em></p><p>It&#x2019;s undeniably sad. <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/twitter-service-vs-platform/" rel="noreferrer">I really liked Twitter</a>, warts and all, from 2007 onward. In fact, it was the only &#x201c;social network&#x201d; I liked at all. Even when it became clear in the Trump era that Twitter was unhealthy for human minds, I soldiered on, gleaning what I could. I&#x2019;m not alone in that; Clay Shirky&#x2019;s moribund signoff at the end of 2022 reflected how I felt:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="I Fight For The Users" class="kg-image" height="1478" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/08/image-252.png" width="1333" /></figure><p>Indeed, Twitter was murdered at the whims of a billionaire high on Ketamine while it was (mostly) healthy, because of <a href="https://www.gbnews.com/news/world/elon-musk-x-twitter-purchase-daughter-jenna-musk-woke-virus" rel="noreferrer">the &#x201c;trans woke virus&#x201d;</a>.  </p><p>I urge you, all of you, <strong>to disavow Twitter and never look at it again</strong>. No one who cares about their mental health should be on Twitter at this point, or linking to Twitter and feeding it the attention it thrives on. We should entomb Twitter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_nuclear_waste_warning_message" rel="noreferrer">deep in concrete</a> with this <a href="https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1279277/" rel="noreferrer">public warning on its capstone</a>:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="I Fight For The Users" class="kg-image" height="1461" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-248.png" width="1293" /></figure><p>In the end, I begrudgingly realized, as did Paul Ford, that Elon unwittingly did us a favor by killing Twitter. He demonstrated <strong>the very real dangers of any platform run by a king, a dictator, a tyrant, a despot, an autocrat</strong>.

We can and should have sane centralized services, of course, but <strong>it&#x2019;s imperative that we <em>also</em> build decentralized services which empower users and give them control</strong>, rather than treating them <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/are-you-a-digital-sharecropper/" rel="noreferrer">like digital sharecroppers</a>. That&#x2019;s what our <a href="https://discourse.org/" rel="noreferrer">Discourse project</a> is all about. I propose collective ownership of the content and the communities we build online.

No, we didn&apos;t get out much. The book itself was a sort of greatest hits compilation of games collected from Ahl&#x2019;s seminal <a href="https://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v10n11/66_Dave_tells_Ahl__the_hist.php">Creative Computing Magazine</a> in the 1970s:</p><blockquote>As soon as Ahl made up his mind to leave DEC, he started laying the groundwork for Creative Computing. He announced intentions to publish the magazine at NCC in June 1974 and over the next few months contacted prospective authors, got mailing lists, arranged for typesetting and printing, and started organizing hundreds of other details.<br /><br />In addition, he also moved his family to Morristown, NJ, and settled into his new job at AT&amp;T. He had little spare capital, so he substituted for it with &#x201c;sweat equity.&#x201d; He edited submitted articles and wrote others. He specified type, took photos, got books of &#x201c;clip art,&#x201d; drew illustrations, and laid out boards. He wrote and laid out circulation flyers, pasted on labels, sorted and bundled mailings.<br /><br />By October 1974, when it was time to specify the first print run, he had just 600 subscribers. But Ahl had no intention of running off just 600 issues. He took all the money he had received, divided it in half, and printed 8000 copies with it. These rolled off the presses October 31, 1974. Ahl recounts the feeling of euphoria on the drive to the printer replaced by dismay when he saw two skids of magazines and wondered how he would ever get them off the premises.

You&#x2019;ll note that the front of the DA2 is totally solid, no air holes, so you do need that extra airflow.</p><p>I only have a few criticisms of this Streacom DA2 case:</p><ul><li>The side panels are tool free, which is excellent, but the pressure fit makes them fairly difficult to remove. Feels like this could be tweaked?</li><li>(Don&#x2019;t even think about using a full sized ATX power supply. In theory it is supported, but the build becomes so much more difficult. Use a SFX power supply, which you&#x2019;d expect to do for a mini-ITX build anyway.)</li><li>My primary complaint is that the <strong>power extension cable gets in the way</strong>. I had to remove it and re-attach it during my build. They should custom route the power cable upwards so it blocks less stuff.</li><li>Less of a criticism and more of an observation: if your build uses a powerful GPU and CPU, you&#x2019;ll need two case fans. There&#x2019;s mounting points for a 92mm fan in the rear, and the bracket system makes it easy to mount a 140mm fan blowing inward. You will definitely need both fans!</li></ul><p>Here&#x2019;s the configuration I recommend, open on both the top and bottom for maximum airflow, with three fans total:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="Building a PC, Part IX: Downsizing" class="kg-image" height="1676" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-165.png" width="2000" /></figure><p>If you are a water cooling kind of person &#x2013; I am definitely not, I experienced one too many traumatic cooling fluid leaks in the early 2000s &#x2013; then you will use that 140mm space for the radiator.</p><p>I have definitely <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/is-your-computer-stable/">burn-in tested</a> this machine, as I do all systems I build, and it passed with flying colors. But to be honest, if you expect to be under full CPU and GPU loads for extended periods of time you <em>might</em> need to switch to water cooling due to the space constraints. (Or pick slightly less powerful components.)</p><p>If you haven&#x2019;t built a PC system recently, it&#x2019;s easier than it has ever been. Heck by the time you install the M.2 drives, memory, CPU, and cooler on the motherboard you&#x2019;re almost done, these days!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="Building a PC, Part IX: Downsizing" class="kg-image" height="2667" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-166.png" width="2000" /></figure><p>There are a lot of interesting <a href="https://yuel-beast-designs.myshopify.com/products/motif-monument">compact mini-itx builds</a> out there.

Remember the&#xa0;<a href="https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Sebastopol-s-Zap-Power-Systems-is-banking-on-3067718.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zappy electric scooter</a>&#xa0;from twenty years ago?</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Rise of the Electric Scooter" class="kg-image" height="1435" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-272.png" width="1240" /></figure><p>What killed the electric scooter back then is the same thing that&#xa0;killed the electric car&#xa0;of year 2000: terrible lead-acid battery technology. It&#x2019;s too heavy, it lacks power, it doesn&#x2019;t have enough range, it takes too long to charge. These are all different ways of saying the same thing:&#xa0;<em>the battery sucks</em>. It wasn&#x2019;t until Lithium Ion batteries matured that both the electric car and the electric scooter &#x2013; and pretty much electric&#xa0;<em>everything</em>, if you think about it &#x2013; became viable.</p><p>Thus, one way to see if Lithium Ion battery prices are indeed generally dropping independent of all other manufacturing concerns is to examine the cost of electric scooters over the last few years. Let&#x2019;s consider one of the most popular models, the Xiaomi Mi M365:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Rise of the Electric Scooter" class="kg-image" height="459" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-273.png" width="766" /></figure><p>This graph only shows roughly two years, from January 2018 to now; it looks like the original price for the Xiaomi M365 when it hit the US market in early 2017 was around $800. So&#xa0;<strong>the price of a popular, common electric scooter has&#xa0;<em>halved</em>&#xa0;in three years.</strong>&#xa0;Very good news indeed for electric vehicles of all types!</p><p>This dramatic drop in electric scooter price from 2016 to 2019 may not be surprising versus the parallel rise of the quasi-legal electric scooter smartphone app rental industry over roughly the same time period, in the form of Bird, Lime, Skip, Spin, Scoot, etc.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Rise of the Electric Scooter" class="kg-image" height="800" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-274.png" width="1200" /></figure><p>Early versions of Bird scooters were&#xa0;<em>actual Xiaomi M365s</em>, slightly modified for rental. Only by late 2018 had they&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_(company)#Vehicles" rel="noreferrer">migrated to</a>&#xa0;custom built, ruggedized scooters optimized for the rental market. The rental industries&#xa0;<a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-bird-scooters-money-profit-strategy-20190505-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">have their own challenges</a>, and ironically have started to pivot to monthly rentals rather than the classic 15 cents per minute.</p><blockquote>Bird has experimented with its business model in recent months. In early March, the company altered its repair program in Los Angeles, which had relied on gig workers to fix broken scooters. It moved repairs in-house (though scooters are still charged each night by an army of gig workers). Later that month, the company introduced scooters with locks in some markets, in a bid to prevent theft and vandalism.<br /><br />In April, it announced the launch of a more traditional rental program in San Francisco and Barcelona, in which users could pay $25 per month to rent a Xiaomi m365 from the company rather than paying per ride.</blockquote><p>But this isn&#x2019;t meant to be a blog entry about the viability of scooter rental company business models.</p><p>I want to tackle a more fundamental question:&#xa0;<strong>are electric scooters the future of transportation?</strong></p><p>Even Uber, as screwed up of a company as they still are, knows cars are overkill for a lot of basic transportation needs:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Rise of the Electric Scooter" class="kg-image" height="844" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/09/image-6.png" width="806" /></figure><p>We have plenty of scooters here at my house, and the family and I enjoy them greatly, but I have never actually ridden or owned an electric scooter. So I bought one. It is of course the popular, inexpensive, and well reviewed&#xa0;Xiaomi Mi M365.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Rise of the Electric Scooter" class="kg-image" height="2048" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-276.png" width="2000" /></figure><p>Here&#x2019;s a picture of my electric scooter inside&#xa0;<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/electric-geek-transportation-systems/">my electric car</a>.

I put Slime in my Mi&#x2019;s tires out of an abundance of caution, but you could also go with solid tubeless tires &#x2013; at the cost of some ride comfort &#x2013; if you&#x2019;re really worried.)</p><p>That&#x2019;s not to say that the electric scooter experience is perfect. There are some challenges with electric scooters, starting with the biggest one:&#xa0;your local government has <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/are-electric-scooters-legal-know-the-law-where-you-live" rel="noreferrer">no idea how to regulate the darn things</a>.</p><ul><li>Is this regulated like a bicycle? If not, why not?</li><li>Are they allowed on the sidewalk?</li><li>Do you have to ride them in the road, with cars&#x2026; uh, depending on the speed limit?</li><li>Do you need a driver&#x2019;s license?</li><li>Do you need a helmet?</li><li>Are you even&#xa0;<em>allowed</em>&#xa0;to legally ride them in public at all outside of private property?</li></ul><p>The answers also vary wildly depending on where you live, and with no consistency or apparent logic. Here are&#xa0;the current <a href="https://bayareabicyclelaw.com/new-e-scooter-laws-2019/" rel="noopener noreferrer">electric scooter laws in California</a>, for what it&#x2019;s worth, which&#xa0;<em>require the rider to have a valid driver&#x2019;s license</em>&#xa0;(unlike electric bicycles) and also disallow them from sidewalks, both of which I feel are onerous and unnecessary restrictions.</p><p>One aspect of those laws I&#xa0;<em>definitely</em>&#xa0;agree with, however, is the&#xa0;<strong>15 mile per hour speed restriction</strong>. That&#x2019;s a plenty brisk top speed for a standing adult with no special safety equipment. Anything faster starts to get decidedly&#x2026; uncomfortable. Consider this monster of a&#xa0;<a href="https://www.ewheels.com/product/new-turbowheel-lightning-957wh-battery-2x-1000w-3600w-motors/" rel="noopener noreferrer">1165KWh electric scooter</a>, with dual motors and dual suspension that goes up to&#xa0;<em>forty freakin&#x2019; miles per hour</em>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>That&#x2026; is&#x2026; terrifying. Even the reviewer, in full motorcycle safety gear, wasn&#x2019;t willing to push it all the way to 40 MPH. And I don&#x2019;t blame him! But now that I&#x2019;ve shown you the undisputed Honda Civic everyman budget model of electric scooter in the M365, hopefully this gives you a taste of the wider emerging diversity in these kinds of minimalistic electric vehicles. If you want a&#xa0;<a href="https://www.unagiscooters.com/products/the-scooter?variant=15012683448435" rel="noopener noreferrer">luxury electric scooter</a>, an&#xa0;<a href="https://fluidfreeride.com/products/mosquito-lightweight-foldable-electric-scooter" rel="noopener noreferrer">ultralight electric scooter</a>, a&#xa0;<a href="https://electrek.co/2019/06/10/widewheel-electric-scooter-off-road-test/" rel="noopener noreferrer">rugged offroad electric scooter</a>&#x2026; all things are possible, for a price.</p><p>Another reason the M365 is available for so cheap is that is successor, the&#xa0;Xiaomi M365 Pro, was recently released, although it is not quite possible to obtain in the US at the moment.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>Having ridden my M365 a fair bit, I can confirm all the Pro improvements are welcome, if incremental: bigger battery and disc brake, more power, better display, improved latch mechanism, etc.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Rise of the Electric Scooter" class="kg-image" height="1070" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-278.png" width="1787" /></figure><p>None of those Pro improvements, however, are worth a 2&#xd7; increase in price so I&#x2019;d recommend sticking with the M365 for now because its value proposition is off the charts. Did I mention there&#x2019;s a Bluetooth connection, and an app, and it is possible to&#xa0;hack the M365 firmware? Pretty cool how electric vehicles are inherently digital, isn&#x2019;t it?</p><p>Here are a few other observations after riding my M365 around a fair bit:</p><ul><li><strong>Please be respectful around pedestrians.</strong>&#xa0;Most of the sidewalks around here are not busy at all, but the pedestrians I encountered on the electric scooter were definitely more freaked out than I&#x2019;ve seen before when using regular kick scooters (or skateboards) on the sidewalk, which did surprise me. An electric scooter has more heft to it, both physically at 26 pounds, and in the 15 mile per hour speed it can reach &#x2013; but also mentally in terms of how it looks and how people approach it. I recommend slowing down to just above walking speed when encountering pedestrians, and if there is a bike lane available, I&#x2019;d definitely recommend using that.</li><li><strong>Hills work great.</strong>&#xa0;The kryptonite of traditional kick scooters is hills, and I&#x2019;m pleased to report that even with a&#xa0;cough&#xa0;sizable adult such as myself riding, I was able to sustain a respectable above-walking speed on most <em>reasonable</em> hills. Where I looked at a hill and thought &#x201c;this probably should work,&#x201d; it did. That&#x2019;s impressive, considering this&#xa0;<em>isn&#x2019;t</em>&#xa0;the upgraded Pro model with bigger battery and more powerful motor. On flats and downhills the performance is superb, as you&#x2019;d expect. That said, if you are a really big or tall adult, or live in a particularly hilly area, wait for the Pro model or an equivalent.</li><li><strong>Portability is good, but borderline.</strong>&#xa0;At ~26 pounds, the electric scooter is reasonably portable, but it&#x2019;s not something you a) could really get away with taking inside a restaurant / store with you to prevent theft or b) want to be carrying around on your person for any significant length of time. It&#x2019;s not nearly as nimble or portable as a kick scooter, but that&#x2019;s a high bar. You&#x2019;ll need to carry a bike lock and think about how to lock your scooter on bike racks, which turned out to be&#x2026; more geometrically challenging than I anticipated due to the small tires, disc brakes, and the engine in the front wheel. They need more obvious locking points on the chassis.</li></ul><p>To be honest with you I&#x2019;m still bitter about the whole&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segway_Inc." rel="noopener noreferrer">Segway</a>&#xa0;debacle. There was so much hype back in the day. That ridiculous thing was&#xa0;<a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/12/1203segway-unveiled/" rel="noopener noreferrer">supposed to change the world</a>.

Are electric scooters the future of (most) transportation? I&#x2019;m not sure, but I do like where we&#x2019;re headed, even if it took us twenty years to get there.</p>'}]}

Maybe it&#x2019;s time for our family to jump on the electric car trend, too, and just late enough that we can avoid the bleeding edge and end up merely on the&#x2026;&#xa0;<em>leading</em>&#xa0;edge?</p><p>That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;re now the proud owners of a fully&#xa0;<a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a26144426/2019-kia-niro-ev-driven/" rel="noopener noreferrer">electric 2019 Kia Niro</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a26144426/2019-kia-niro-ev-driven/" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></p><p>I&#x2019;ve somehow gone from being a person who basically doesn&#x2019;t care about cars at all&#x2026; to being&#xa0;<strong>one of those insufferable electric car people who won&#x2019;t shut up about them</strong>. I apologize in advance. If you suddenly feel an overwhelming urge to close this browser tab, I don&#x2019;t blame you.</p><p>I was expecting another car, like the three we bought before. What I got, instead, was a transformation:</p><ul><li>Yes, yes, electric cars are clean, but it&#x2019;s a revelation how clean&#xa0;<em>everything</em>&#xa0;is in an electric. You take for granted how dirty and noisy gas based cars are in daily operation &#x2013; the engine noise, the exhaust fumes, the brake dust on the rims, the oily residues and thin black film that descends on everything, the way you have to wash your hands every time you use the gas station pumps. You don&#x2019;t fully appreciate how oppressive those little dirty details were until they&#x2019;re gone.</li><li>Electric cars are (almost) completely silent. I guess technically in 2019 electric cars require artificial soundmakers at low speed for safety, and this car has one. But The Oatmeal was right. Electric cars&#xa0;<em>feel</em>&#xa0;like spacecraft because they move so effortlessly. There&#x2019;s virtually no delay from action to reaction, near immediate acceleration and deceleration&#x2026; with almost no sound or vibration at all, like you&#x2019;re in freakin&#x2019; space! It&#x2019;s so immensely satisfying!</li><li>Electric cars aren&#x2019;t just&#xa0;<em>electric</em>, they&#x2019;re utterly digital to their very core. Gas cars always felt like the classic 1950s Pixar Cars world of grease monkeys and machine shop guys, maybe with a few digital bobbins added here and there as an afterthought. This electric car, on the other hand, is squarely in the post-iPhone world of everyday digital gadgets. It feels more like a giant smartphone than a car. I am a programmer, I&#x2019;m a digital guy, I love digital stuff. And electric cars are part of&#xa0;<em>my</em>&#xa0;world, rather than the other way around. It feels good.</li><li>Electric cars are mechanically much simpler than gasoline cars, which means they are inherently more reliable and cheaper to maintain. An internal combustion engine has hundreds of moving parts, many of which require regular maintenance, fluids, filters, and tune ups. It also has a complex transmission to translate the narrow power band of a gas powered engine. None of this is necessary on an electric vehicle, whose electric motor is basically one moving part with simple 100% direct drive from the motor to the wheels. This newfound simplicity is deeply appealing to a guy who always saw cars as incredibly complicated (but computers, not so much).</li><li>Being able to charge at home overnight is perhaps the most radical transformation of all. Your house is now a &#x201c;gas station.&#x201d; Our Kia Niro has a range of about&#xa0;<strong>250 miles</strong>&#xa0;on a full battery. With any modern electric car, provided you drive less than 200 miles a day round trip (who even drives this much?), it&#x2019;s very unlikely you&#x2019;ll ever need to &#x201c;fill the tank&#x201d; anywhere but at home. Ever. It&#x2019;s so strange to think that in 50 years, <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/As-EVs-threaten-gas-stations-owners-turn-to-14291843.php" rel="noreferrer">gas stations&#xa0;may eventually be as odd</a> to see in public as public telephone booths now are. Our charger is, conveniently enough, right next to the driveway since that&#x2019;s where the power breaker box was. With the level 2 charger installed, it literally&#xa0;<em>looks</em>&#xa0;like a gas pump on the side of the house, except this one &#x201c;pumps&#x201d;&#x2026; electrons.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="Electric Geek Transportation Systems" class="kg-image" height="2667" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/08/level-2-ev-charger.jpg" width="2000" /></figure><p>This electric car is such a great experience. It&#x2019;s so much better than our gas powered station wagon that I swear, if there was a fully electric minivan (there isn&#x2019;t) I would literally sell our Honda minivan&#xa0;<em>tomorrow</em>&#xa0;and switch over. Without question. And believe me, I had no plans to sell that vehicle two months ago. The electric car is&#xa0;<em>that much better</em>.</p><p>I was expecting &#x201c;yet another car,&#x201d; but what I got instead was a new, radical worldview. Driving a car powered by barely controlled liquid fuel detonations used to be normal. But in an world of more and more viable electric vehicles this status quo increasingly starts to feel&#x2026; deeply unnatural. Electric is so much better of an overall experience that you begin to wonder: why did we&#xa0;<em>ever</em>&#xa0;do it that way?</p><p>Gas cars seem, for lack of a better word,&#xa0;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-ev-oil-crisis/" rel="noreferrer"><em>obsolete</em></a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-ev-oil-crisis/"><img alt="Electric Geek Transportation Systems" class="kg-image" height="533" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/08/ev-sales.jpg" width="740" /></a></figure><p>How did this transformation happen, from my perspective, so suddenly? When exactly did electric cars go from &#x201c;expensive, experimental thing for crazy people&#x201d; to &#x201c;By God, I&#x2019;ll never buy another old fashioned gasoline based car if I can help it&#x201d;?</p><p>I was vaguely aware of the early electric cars. I even remember one coworker circa 2001 who owned a bright neon green Honda Insight. I ignored it all because, like I said,&#xa0;<em>I&#x2019;m not a car guy</em>. I needed to do the research to understand the history, and I started with the often recommended documentary,&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Killed_the_Electric_Car%3F" rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Killed the Electric Car?</a></p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>This is mostly about the original highly experimental&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_EV1" rel="noopener noreferrer">General Motors EV1</a>&#xa0;from 1996 to 1999. It&#x2019;s so early the first models had lead-acid batteries! &#x1f631; There&#x2019;s a number of conspiracy theories floated in the video, but I think the simple answer to the implied question in the title is straight up&#xa0;<em>price</em>. The battery tech was nowhere near ready, and per the Wikipedia article the estimated actual cost of the car was somewhere between $100,000 and $250,000 though I suspect it was much closer to the latter. It is interesting to note how much the owners (well, leasers) loved their EV1s. Having gone through that same conversion myself, I empathize!</p><p>I then watched the sequel,&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenge_of_the_Electric_Car" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revenge of the Electric Car</a>. This one is essential, because it covers the dawn of the modern electric car we have today.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>This chronicles the creation of three very influential early electric cars &#x2013; the&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Leaf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nissan Leaf</a>, the&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Volt" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chevy Volt</a>, and of course the&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Roadster_(2008)" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tesla Roadster</a>&#xa0;from 2005 - 2008. The precise moment that Lithium-Ion batteries were in play &#x2013; that&#x2019;s when electric cars started to become viable. Every one of these three electric cars was well conceived and made it to market in volume, though not without significant challenges, both internal and external. None of them were perfect electric vehicles by any means: the Roadster was $100k, the Leaf had limited range, and the Volt was still technically a hybrid, albeit only using the gasoline engine to charge the battery.</p><p>Ten years later, Tesla has the model 3 at $38,000 and we bought our Kia Niro for about the same price. After national and state tax incentives and rebates, that puts the price at around $30,000. It&#x2019;s not as cheap as it needs to be&#x2026; yet. But it&#x2019;s getting there. And it&#x2019;s&#xa0;already <a href="https://www.corporateknights.com/channels/clean-technology/faceoff-electric-vs-gas-cars-on-cost-15555966/" rel="noopener noreferrer">competitive with gasoline vehicles</a> in 2019.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="Electric Geek Transportation Systems" class="kg-image" height="1126" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/08/2019-civic-vs-leaf-1.jpg" width="1067" /></figure><p>It&#x2019;s still early, but the trend lines are clear. And I&#x2019;m here to tell you that right now, today, I&#x2019;d buy&#xa0;<em>any</em>&#xa0;modern electric car over a gasoline powered car.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>If you too are intrigued by the idea of owning an electric car,&#xa0;<em>you should be</em>. It&#x2019;s freaking awesome! Bring your skepticism, as always; I highly recommend the above Matt Ferrell explainer video on electric vehicle myths.</p><p>As for me, I have seen the future, and it is absolutely, inexorably, and unavoidably&#x2026; electric.&#x26a1;</p>'}]}

The best summary is Maciej Ceg&#x142;owski&#x2019;s,&#xa0;<a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Website Obesity Crisis</a>:</p><blockquote>To channel a famous motivational speaker, I could go out there tonight, with the materials you&#x2019;ve got, and rewrite the sites I showed you at the start of this talk to make them load in under a second. In two hours.<br /><br />Can you? Can you?<br /><br />Of course you can! It&#x2019;s not hard! We knew how to make small websites in 2002. It&#x2019;s not like the secret has been lost to history, like Greek fire or Damascus steel.<br /><br />But we face pressure to make these sites bloated.<br /><br />I bet if you went to a client and presented a 200 kilobyte site template, you&#x2019;d be fired. Even if it looked great and somehow included all the tracking and ads and social media crap they insisted on putting in. It&#x2019;s just so far out of the realm of the imaginable at this point.</blockquote><p>The&#xa0;whole article is essential; you should stop what you&#x2019;re doing and read it now if you haven&#x2019;t already. But if you don&#x2019;t have time, here&#x2019;s the key point:</p><blockquote>This is a screenshot from an NPR article discussing the rising use of ad blockers. The page is 12 megabytes in size in a stock web browser.&#xa0;<strong>The same article with basic ad blocking turned on is 1 megabyte.</strong></blockquote><p>That&#x2019;s right, through the simple act of running an ad blocker, you&#x2019;ve reduced that website&#x2019;s payload by twelve times. Twelve! That&#x2019;s like the most effective exercise program&#xa0;<em>ever!</em></p><p>Even the traditional advice to&#xa0;keep websites lean and mean for mobile&#xa0;no longer applies because new mobile devices, at least on the Apple side, are&#xa0;<em>faster than most existing desktops and laptops.</em></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="An Exercise Program for the Fat Web" class="kg-image" height="832" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/09/image-5.png" width="803" /></figure><p>Despite&#xa0;<a href="https://danluu.com/web-bloat/" rel="noopener noreferrer">claims to the contrary</a>, the bad guy isn&#x2019;t web bloat, per se.&#xa0;<strong>The bad guy is&#xa0;<em>advertising</em></strong>.

There&#x2019;s a&#xa0;<em>reason</em>&#xa0;the most popular browser plugins are inevitably ad blockers, isn&#x2019;t there? Just ask Google:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="An Exercise Program for the Fat Web" class="kg-image" height="458" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-263.png" width="1151" /></figure><p>So it&#x2019;s all the more surprising to learn that Google is suddenly <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/05/29/chrome-ad-blocking-enterprise-manifest-v3/" rel="noopener noreferrer">clamping down hard on adblockers</a> in Chrome. Here&#x2019;s what the author of uBlock Origin, an ad blocking plugin for Chrome,&#xa0;<a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBlock-issues/issues/338#issuecomment-496009417" rel="noopener noreferrer">has to say</a>&#xa0;about today&#x2019;s announcement:</p><blockquote>In order for Google Chrome to reach its current user base, it had to support content blockers &#x2013; these are the top most popular extensions for any browser. Google strategy has been to find the optimal point between the two goals of growing the user base of Google Chrome and preventing content blockers from harming its business.<br /><br />The blocking ability of the webRequest API caused Google to yield control of content blocking to content blockers. Now that Google Chrome is the dominant browser, it is in a better position to shift the optimal point between the two goals which benefits Google&#x2019;s primary business.<br /><br />The deprecation of the blocking ability of the webRequest API is to gain back this control, and to further instrument and report how web pages are filtered, since the exact filters which are applied to web pages are useful information which will be collectable by Google Chrome.</blockquote><p>The ad blockers themselves are arguably just as complicit. Eye/o GmbH owns&#xa0;<a href="https://adblockplus.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">AdBlock</a>&#xa0;and&#xa0;<a href="https://www.ublock.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">uBlock</a>, employs 150 people, and in 2016 they had 50 million euros in revenue, of which about 50% was profit.

Given the plateauing of CPU speeds, I think five years of useful life for these boxes is realistic, but let&#x2019;s assume a conservative three year lifespan to be safe.</p><ul><li>$880 mini-pc 32GB RAM, 6 CPUs, 500GB SSD</li><li>$120 taxes / shipping / misc</li><li>$29 &#xd7; 12 &#xd7; 3 = $1,044</li></ul><p>That&#x2019;s&#xa0;<strong>$2,044 for three years of hosting</strong>. How can we do on Digital Ocean? Per&#xa0;<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/" rel="noopener noreferrer">their current pricing page</a>:</p><ul><li>32GB RAM, 8 vCPUs, 640GB SSD</li><li>$160/month</li><li>$160 &#xd7; 12 &#xd7; 3 =&#xa0;<strong>$5,760</strong></li></ul><p>This isn&#x2019;t&#xa0;<em>quite</em>&#xa0;apples to apples, as we are getting an extra 140GB of disk and 2 bonus CPUs, but those CPUs are both slower and partially consumed by multi-tenancy compared to our brand new dedicated, isolated CPUs. (I was curious about this, so I just spun up a new $160/month DO instance for a quick test. The&#xa0;<code>sysbench</code>&#xa0;results are 4086 and 11760 respectively, considerably below the 2019 Mini-PC results, above.) As you can see,&#xa0;<strong>you pay almost three times as much for a cloud server.</strong>&#xa0;&#x1f911;</p><p>I&#x2019;m not saying this is for everyone. If you just need to spin up a quick server or two for testing and experimentation, there&#x2019;s absolutely no way you need to go to the trouble and up-front cost of building and then racking colocated mini-pcs. There&#x2019;s no denying that spinning servers up in the cloud offers unparalleled flexibility and redundancy. But if you do have need for&#xa0;<strong>dedicated computing resources over a period of years</strong>, then building your own small personal cloud, with machines <em>you actually own</em>, is not only one third the cost but also&#x2026; kinda cool?</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Cloud Is Just Someone Else&#x2019;s Computer" class="kg-image" height="1592" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/02/your-own-personal-cloud.jpg" width="1200" /></figure><p>If you&#x2019;d also like to embark upon this project, you can get the same Partaker B18 box I did for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Partaker-Coffee-Graphics-Barebone-System/dp/B07L4KJXWL" rel="noreferrer">$490 from Amazon</a>, or&#xa0;$460 direct from China via AliExpress.

It&#x2019;s just a little something I like to do, you know...&#xa0;<em>for me</em>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="What does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?" class="kg-image" height="962" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-27.png" width="960" /></figure><p>Thus, what I&#x2019;d like to do right now is peer into that glorious abyss for a bit and introspect about&#xa0;<strong>the challenges I see facing Stack Overflow for the next 10 years.</strong>&#xa0;Before I begin, I do want to be absolutely crystal clear about a few things:</p><ol><li>I <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/farewell-stack-exchange/" rel="noreferrer">have not worked at Stack Overflow</a> in any capacity whatsoever&#xa0;since February 2012&#xa0;and I&#x2019;ve had zero day-to-day operational input since that date, more or less by choice. Do I have opinions about how things should be done? Uh, have you&#xa0;<em>met me?</em>&#xa0;Do I email people every now and then about said opinions? I might, but I honestly do try to keep it to an absolute minimum, and I think my email archive track record here is reasonable.</li><li>The people working at Stack are amazing and most of them (including much of the Stack Overflow community, while I&#x2019;m at it) could articulate the mission better &#x2014; and perhaps a tad less crankily &#x2014; than I could by the time I left. Would I trust them with my life? No. But I&#x2019;d trust them with Joel&#x2019;s life!</li><li>The whole point of the Stack Overflow exercise is that it&#x2019;s not beholden to me, or Joel, or&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory" rel="noopener noreferrer">any other Great Person</a>. Stack Overflow works because it empowers regular everyday programmers all over the world, just like you, just like me. I guess in my mind it&#x2019;s akin to being a parent. The goal is for your children to eventually grow up to be sane, practicing adults who don&#x2019;t need (or, really,&#xa0;<em>want</em>) you to hang around any more.</li><li>Understand that you&#x2019;re reading&#xa0;<s>the weak opinions strongly held</s>&#xa0;the <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/strong-opinions-weakly-held/">strong opinions weakly held</a>&#xa0;of a co-founder who spent prodigious amounts of time working with the community in the first four years of Stack Overflow&#x2019;s life to shape the rules and norms of the site to fit their needs. These are merely my opinions. I like to think they are&#xa0;<em>informed</em>&#xa0;opinions, but that doesn&#x2019;t necessarily mean I can predict the future, or that I am even qualified to try. But I&#x2019;ve never let being &#x201c;qualified&#x201d; stop me from doing anything, and I ain&#x2019;t about to start tonight.</li></ol><h3 id="stack-overflow-is-a-wiki-first">Stack Overflow is a wiki first</h3><p>Stack Overflow ultimately has&#xa0;<em>much</em>&#xa0;more in common with Wikipedia than a discussion forum. By this I mean questions and answers on Stack Overflow are not primarily judged by their usefulness to a specific individual, but by&#xa0;<strong>how many <em>other</em>&#xa0;programmers that question or answer can potentially help over time</strong>. I tried as hard as I could to emphasize this relationship from&#xa0;launch day in 2008. Note who has top billing in this Venn diagram.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="What does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?" class="kg-image" height="431" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/10/stack-overflow-venn-diagram.png" width="440" /></figure><p>Stack Overflow later added a super neat feature to highlight this core value in user profiles, where it shows how many other people you have potentially helped with your contributed questions and answers so far.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="What does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?" class="kg-image" height="368" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/10/stackoverflow-people-reached-profile-stat-1.png" width="431" /></figure><p>The most common complaints I see about Stack Overflow are usually the result of this fundamental misunderstanding about who the questions and answers on the site are ultimately&#xa0;<em>for</em>, and why there&#x2019;s so much strictness involved in the whole process.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="What does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?" class="kg-image" height="398" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/09/image-4.png" width="1090" /></figure><p>I&#x2019;m continually amazed at the number of people, even on Hacker News today, who don&#x2019;t realize that every single question and answer is editable on Stack Overflow, even as a completely anonymous user who isn&#x2019;t logged in. Which makes sense, right,&#xa0;<em>because Stack Overflow is a wiki</em>, and that&#x2019;s how wikis work. Anyone can edit them. Go ahead, try it right now if you don&#x2019;t believe me &#x2013; press the &#x201c;improve this answer&#x201d; or &#x201c;improve this question&#x201d; button on anything that can be improved, and make it so.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="What does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?" class="kg-image" height="323" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/10/stack-overflow-edit-question.png" width="861" /></figure><p>The responsibility for this misunderstanding is all on Stack Overflow (and by that I also mean myself, at least up until 2012). I guess the logic is that &#x201c;every programmer has surely seen, used, and understands Stack Overflow by now, 10 years in&#x201d; but... I think that&#x2019;s a risky assumption. New programmers are minted every second of every day. Complicating matters further, there are three tiers of usage at Stack Overflow, from biggest to smallest, in inverted pyramid style:</p><ol><li><strong>I passively search for programming answers. </strong>Passively searching and reading highly ranked Stack Overflow answers as they appear in web search results is arguably the&#xa0;<em>primary goal of Stack Overflow</em>. If Stack Overflow is working like it&#x2019;s supposed to, 98% of programmers should get all the answers they need from reading search result pages and wouldn&#x2019;t need to ask or answer a single question in their entire careers. This is a good thing! Great, even!</li><li><strong>I participate on Stack Overflow when I get stuck on a really hairy problem and searching isn&#x2019;t helping. </strong>Participating only at those times when you are extra stuck is completely valid. However, I feel this level is where most people tend to run into difficulty on Stack Overflow, because it involves someone who may not be new to Stack Overflow per se, but is new to asking questions, and also at the precise time of stress and tension for them where they&#xa0;<em>must</em>&#xa0;get an answer due to a problem they&#x2019;re facing&#x2026; and they don&#x2019;t have the time or inclination to deal with Stack Overflow&#x2019;s strict wiki type requirements for research effort, formatting, showing previous work, and referencing what they found in prior searches.</li><li><strong>I participate on Stack Overflow for professional development. </strong>At this level you&#x2019;re talking about experienced Stack Overflow users who have contributed many answers and thus have a pretty good idea of what makes a great question, the kind they&#x2019;d want to answer themselves. As a result, they don&#x2019;t tend to ask many questions because they self-medicate through exhaustive searching and research, but when they do ask one, their questions are exemplary.</li></ol><p>(There&#x2019;s technically a fourth tier here, for people who want to selflessly contribute creative commons questions and answers to move the entire field of software development forward for the next generation of software developers.

The primary place to deal with this, in my opinion, is a&#xa0;<strong>massively revamped and improved ask page</strong>. It&#x2019;s also fair to note that maybe people don&#x2019;t understand that they&#x2019;re signing up for a sizable chunk of work by implicitly committing to the wiki standard of &#x201c;try to make sure it&#x2019;s useful to more people than just yourself&#x201d; when asking a question on Stack Overflow, and are then put off by the negative reaction to what others view as an insufficiently researched question.</p><p>Stack Overflow absorbs so much tension from its adoption of wiki standards for content. Even if you know about that requirement up front, it is not always clear what &#x201c;useful&#x201d; means, in the same way it&#x2019;s not always clear what topics, people, and places are deserving of a Wikipedia page.&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Lacks" rel="noopener noreferrer">Henrietta Lacks</a>, absolutely, but what about your cousin Dave in Omaha with his weirdo PHP 5.6 issue?</p><h3 id="over-time-duplicates-become-vast-landmine-fields">Over time, duplicates become vast landmine fields</h3><p>Here&#x2019;s one thing&#xa0;I really, really saw coming&#xa0;and to be honest with you I was kinda glad I left in 2012 before I had to deal with it because of the incredible technical difficulty involved:&#xa0;<a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/04/29/handling-duplicate-questions/" rel="noreferrer"><strong>duplicates</strong></a>. Of all the complaints I hear about Stack Overflow, this is the one I am most sympathetic to by far.</p><p>If you accept that Stack Overflow is a wiki type system, then for the same reasons that you obviously can&#x2019;t have five different articles about Italy on Wikipedia,&#xa0;<strong>Stack Overflow can&#x2019;t allow duplicate questions on the exact same programming problem</strong>. While there is a fair amount of code to do pre-emptive searches as people type in questions, plus&#xa0;<em>many</em>&#xa0;exhortations to search before you ask, with an inviting search field and button right there on the mandatory page you see before asking your first question...</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="What does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?" class="kg-image" height="539" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-29.png" width="1313" /></figure><p>...locating and identifying duplicate content is an insanely difficult problem even for a company like Google that&#x2019;s done nothing but specialize in this exact problem for, what, 20 years now, with a veritable army of the world&#x2019;s most talented engineers.</p><p>When you&#x2019;re asking a question on a site that doesn&#x2019;t allow duplicate questions, the problem space of a site with 1 million existing questions is rather different from a site with 10 million existing questions... or 100 million. Asking a single unique question goes from mildly difficult to mission almost impossible, because your question needs to thread a narrow path through this vast, enormous field of prior art questions without stepping on any of the vaguely similar looking landmines in the process.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="What does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?" class="kg-image" height="532" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/10/stackoverflow-asking-duplicate-question.png" width="941" /></figure><p>But wait!&#xa0;<em>It gets harder!</em></p><ul><li>Some <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/11/16/dr-strangedupe-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-duplication/" rel="noopener noreferrer">variance in similar-ish questions</a> is OK, because 10 different people will ask a nearly identical question using 10 different sets of completely unrelated words with no overlap. I know, it sounds crazy, but trust me: humans are amazing at this. We want all those duplicates to exist so they can&#xa0;<em>point to</em>&#xa0;the primary question they are a duplicate of, while still being valid search targets for people who ask questions with unusual or rare word choices.</li><li>It can be legitimately difficult to determine if your question is a true duplicate. How much overlap is enough before one programming question is a duplicate of another? And by whose definition? Opinions vary. This is subject to human interpretation, and humans are.. unreliable. Nobody will ever be completely happy with this system, pretty much by design. That tension is baked in permanently and forever.</li></ul><p>I don&#x2019;t have any real answers on the duplicate problem, which only gets worse over time. But I will point out that there is plenty of precedent&#xa0;on <a href="https://stackexchange.com/sites#traffic" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Stack Exchange network</a>&#xa0;for splitting sites into &#x201c;expert&#x201d; and &#x201c;beginner&#x201d; areas with slightly different rulesets. We&#x2019;ve seen this for Math vs. MathOverflow, English vs. English Learners, Unix vs. Ubuntu...&#xa0;<strong>perhaps it&#x2019;s time for a more beginner focused Stack Overflow</strong>&#xa0;where duplicates are less frowned upon, and conversational rules are a bit more lenient?</p><h3 id="stack-overflow-is-a-competitive-system-of-peer-review">Stack Overflow is a competitive system of peer review</h3><p>Stack Overflow was indeed built to be a fairly explicitly competitive system, with the caveat that&#xa0;&#x201c;there&#x2019;s <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?ThereIsMoreThanOneWayToDoIt" rel="noopener noreferrer">always more than one way</a>&#xa0;to do it.&#x201d; This design choice was based on my perennial observation that the best way to motivate any programmer... is to subtly insinuate that&#xa0;<em>another</em>&#xa0;programmer could have maybe done it better.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="What does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?" class="kg-image" height="572" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-30.png" width="1462" /></figure><p>This is manifested in the <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/for-a-bit-of-colored-ribbon/" rel="noreferrer">public reputation</a> system on Stack Overflow, the incredible power of a number printed next to someone&#x2019;s name, writ large.

The&#xa0;<em>intent</em>&#xa0;is for Stack Overflow to be a system of peer review and friendly competition, like a code review from a coworker you&#x2019;ve never met at a different division of the company. It&#x2019;s also completely fair for a fellow programmer to question the premise of your question, as long as it&#x2019;s done in a nice way. For example,&#xa0;do you really want to use that <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags" rel="noopener noreferrer">regular expression to match HTML</a>?</p><p>I fully acknowledge that&#xa0;<strong>competitive peer review systems aren&#x2019;t for everyone</strong>, and thus the overall process of having peers review your question may not always feel great, depending on your circumstances and background in the field &#x2013;&#xa0;<em>particularly</em>&#xa0;when combined with the substantial tensions around utility and duplicates Stack Overflow already absorbed from its wiki elements. Kind of a double whammy there.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve heard people describe the process of asking a question on Stack Overflow as anxiety inducing. To me, posting on Stack Overflow is&#xa0;<em>supposed</em>&#xa0;to involve a healthy kind of minor &#x201c;let me be sure to show off my best work&#x201d; anxiety:</p><ul><li>the anxiety of giving a presentation to your fellow peers</li><li>the anxiety of doing well on a test</li><li>the anxiety of showing up to a new job with talented coworkers you admire</li><li>the anxiety of attending your first day at school with other students at your level</li></ul><p>I imagine systems where there is zero anxiety involved and I can only think of jobs where I had long since stopped caring about the work and thus had no anxiety about whether I even showed for work on any given day. How can that be good? Let&#x2019;s just say I&#x2019;m not a fan of zero-anxiety systems.</p><p>Maybe competition just isn&#x2019;t your jam. Could there be a less competitive Q&amp;A system, a system without downvotes, a system without close votes, where there was never any anxiety about posting anything, just a network of super supportive folks who believe in you and want you to succeed no matter what? Absolutely! I think many alternative sites&#xa0;<em>should</em>&#xa0;exist on the internet so people can choose an experience that matches their personal preferences and goals. Should Stack build that alternative? Has it already been built? It&#x2019;s an open question; feel free to point out examples in the comments.</p><h3 id="stack-overflow-is-designed-for-practicing-programmers">Stack Overflow is designed for practicing programmers</h3><p>Another point of confusion that comes up a fair bit is who the intended audience for Stack Overflow actually is. That one is straightforward, and it&#x2019;s been the same from day one:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="What does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?" class="kg-image" height="557" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/10/stackoverflow-for-business-description.png" width="558" /></figure><p>Q&amp;A for&#xa0;<strong>professional and enthusiast programmers</strong>. By that we mean:</p><blockquote>People who either already have a job as a programmer, or could potentially be hired as a programmer today if they wanted to be.</blockquote><p>Yes, in case you&#x2019;re wondering, part of this was an overt business decision. To make money you must have an audience of people already on a programmer&#x2019;s salary, or in the job hunt to be a programmer. The entire Stack Overflow network may be Creative Commons licensed, but it was never a non-profit play. It was planned as a sustainable business from the outset, and that&#x2019;s why&#xa0;we <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/stack-overflow-careers-amplifying-your-awesome/">launched Stack Overflow Careers</a>&#xa0;only one year after Stack Overflow itself... to be honest far sooner than we should have, in retrospect. Careers has since been smartly subsumed into Stack Overflow proper at&#xa0;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/jobs" rel="noopener noreferrer">stackoverflow.com/jobs</a>&#xa0;for a more integrated and most assuredly way-better-than-2009 experience.</p><p>The choice of audience wasn&#x2019;t meant to be an exclusionary decision in any way, but Stack Overflow was definitely designed as a fairly strict system of peer review, which is great (IMNSHO, obviously) for already practicing professionals, but&#xa0;<strong>pretty much everything you would&#xa0;<em>not</em>&#xa0;want as a student or beginner</strong>. This is why I cringe so hard I practically turn myself inside out when people on Twitter mention that they have pointed their students at Stack Overflow. What you&#x2019;d want for a beginner or a student in the field of programming is almost&#xa0;<em>the exact opposite</em>&#xa0;of what Stack Overflow does at every turn:</p><ul><li>one-on-one mentoring</li><li>real time collaborative screen sharing</li><li>live chat</li><li>theory and background courses</li><li>starter tasks and exercises</li><li>playgrounds to experiment in</li></ul><p>These are all very fine and good things, but Stack Overflow does&#xa0;<em>NONE</em>&#xa0;of them, by design.</p><p><em>Can</em>&#xa0;you use Stack Overflow to learn how to program from first principles? Well, technically you can do anything with any software. You could try to have actual conversations on Reddit, if you&#x2019;re a masochist. But the answer is yes. You could learn how to program on Stack Overflow, in theory, if you are a prodigy who is comfortable with the light competitive aspects (reputation, closing, downvoting) and also perfectly willing to define all your contributions to the site in terms of utility to others, not just yourself as a student attempting to learn things. But I&#xa0;<em>suuuuuuper</em>&#xa0;would not recommend it. There are&#xa0;far better websites and systems out there for <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/heres-the-programming-game-you-never-asked-for/">learning to be a programmer</a>.&#xa0;<em>Could</em>&#xa0;Stack Overflow build beginner and student friendly systems like this? I don&#x2019;t know, and it&#x2019;s certainly not my call to make. &#x1f914;</p><p>And that&#x2019;s it. We can now resume our normal non-abyss gazing. Or whatever it is that passes for normal in these times.</p><p>I hope all of this doesn&#x2019;t come across as negative. Overall I&#x2019;d say the state of the Stack is strong. But does it even matter what I think?&#xa0;<a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2008/11/25/stack-overflow-is-you/" rel="noopener noreferrer">As it was in 2008</a>, so it is in 2018.</p><blockquote><strong>Stack Overflow is&#xa0;<em>you</em>.</strong><br /><br />This is the scary part, the great leap of faith that Stack Overflow is predicated on: trusting your fellow programmers. The programmers who choose to participate in Stack Overflow are the &#x201c;secret sauce&#x201d; that makes it work. You are the reason I continue to believe in developer community as the greatest source of learning and growth. You are the reason I continue to get so many positive emails and testimonials about Stack Overflow. I can&#x2019;t take credit for that. But you can.<br /><br />I learned the collective power of my fellow programmers long ago writing on Coding Horror. The community is far, far smarter than I will ever be. All I can ask &#x2014; all any of us can ask &#x2014; is to help each other along the path.<br /><br />And if your fellow programmers decide to recognize you for that, then I say you&#x2019;ve well and truly earned it.</blockquote><p>The strength of Stack Overflow begins, and ends, with the&#xa0;community of <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">programmers that power the site</a>.

Once they gain access to a person&#x2019;s inbox, they use it to prepare to their next attack. They&#x2019;ll harvest existing email addresses, subject lines, content, and attachments to construct plausible looking boobytrapped emails and mail them to all of&#xa0;<em>their</em>&#xa0;contacts. How sophisticated and targeted to a particular person this effort is determines whether it&#x2019;s so-called &#x201c;spear&#x201d; phishing or not.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security" class="kg-image" height="742" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/phishing-vs-spear-phishing.png" width="1972" /></figure><p>In this case is it was not at all targeted. This is a remarkably unsophisticated, absolutely generic routine phishing attack. There is zero focused attack effort on display here.

Here&#x2019;s the kicker:</p><blockquote>Mr. Delavan, in an interview, said that his bad advice was a result of a typo: He knew this was a phishing attack, as the campaign was getting dozens of them. He said&#xa0;<strong>he had meant to type that it was an &#x201c;illegitimate&#x201d; email, an error that he said has plagued him ever since.</strong></blockquote><p>One word. He got&#xa0;<em>one</em>&#xa0;word wrong. But what a word to get wrong, and in the first sentence! The email did provide the proper Google address to reset your password. But the lede was already buried since the first sentence said &#x201c;legitimate;&#x201d; the phishing link in that email was then clicked. And the rest is literally history.</p><p>What&#x2019;s even funnier (well, in the way of gallows humor, I guess) is that public stats were left enabled for that bit.ly tracking link, so you can see exactly what crazy domain that &#x201c;Google login page&#x201d; resolved to, and that it was clicked exactly twice, on the same day it was mailed.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security" class="kg-image" height="715" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/bitly-podesta-tracking-link.png" width="1120" /></figure><p>As I said, these were not exactly sophisticated attackers. So yeah, in&#xa0;<em>theory</em>&#xa0;an attentive user could pay attention to the browser&#x2019;s address bar and notice that after clicking the link, they arrived at</p><p><code>http://myaccount.google.com-securitysettingpage.tk/security/signinoptions/password</code></p><p>instead of</p><p><code>https://myaccount.google.com/security</code></p><p>Note that the phishing URL is carefully constructed so the most &#x201c;correct&#x201d; part is at the front, and weirdness is sandwiched in the middle. Unless you&#x2019;re paying very close attention and your address bar is long enough to expose the full URL, it&#x2019;s&#x2026; tricky.

These three short sentences are the 60 second summary of what you want to do, and what you want to share with others so&#xa0;<em>they</em>&#xa0;do, too.</p><p><strong>1) Enable Two Factor authentication through an app, and&#xa0;<em>not SMS</em>, everywhere you can.</strong></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security" class="kg-image" height="481" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/google-2fa-1.png" width="566" /></figure><p>Logging in with only a password, now matter how long and unique you attempt to make that password, will never be enough. A password is what you know; you need to add the second factor of something you&#xa0;<em>have</em>&#xa0;(or something you&#xa0;<em>are</em>) to achieve significant additional security. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/phone-numbers-indentification-authentication/" rel="noreferrer">SMS can famously&#xa0;be intercepted</a>, social engineered, or sim-jacked all too easily. If it&#x2019;s SMS, it&#x2019;s not secure,&#xa0;<em>period</em>. So install an authenticator app, and use it, at least for your most important credentials such as your email account and your bank.</p><p>Have I mentioned that Discourse&#xa0;added <a href="https://blog.discourse.org/2018/05/discourse-2-0-released/" rel="noopener noreferrer">two factor authentication support</a> in version 2.0, and our just released 2.1 adds printed backup codes, too? There are two paths forward: you can&#xa0;<em>talk</em>&#xa0;about the solution, or you can&#xa0;<em>build</em>&#xa0;the solution. I&#x2019;m trying to do both to the best of my ability. Look for the 2FA auth option in your user preferences on your favorite Discourse instance. It&#x2019;s there for you.</p><p>(This is also a company policy at Discourse; if you work here,&#xa0;<em>you 2FA everything all the time</em>. No other login option exists.)</p><p><strong>2) Make all your passwords 11 characters or more.</strong></p><p>It&#x2019;s <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/hacker-hack-thyself/">a long story</a>, but anything under 11 characters&#xa0;is basically the <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/your-password-is-too-damn-short/" rel="noreferrer">same as having no password</a> at all&#xa0;these days. I personally recommend at least 14 characters, maybe even 16. But this won&#x2019;t be a problem for you, because...</p><p><strong>3) Use a password manager.</strong></p><p>If you use a password manager, you can simultaneously avoid the pernicious danger of password re-use and&#xa0;the difficulty of coming up with <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/password-rules-are-bullshit/">unique and random passwords</a>&#xa0;all the time. It is my hope in the long run that cloud based password management gets deeply built into Android, iOS, OSX, and Windows so that people don&#x2019;t need to run a weird m&#xe9;lange of third party apps to achieve this essential task. Password management is foundational and should not be the province of third parties on principle, because you never outsource a core competency.</p><p><strong>Bonus rule! For the particularly at-risk, get and use a U2F key.</strong></p><p>In the long term, two factor through an app isn&#x2019;t quite secure enough due to the very real (and growing) specter of real-time phishing. Authentication apps offer timed keys that expire after a minute or two, but if the attacker can get you to type an authentication key and relay it to the target site fast enough, they can still log in as you. If you need ultimate protection,&#xa0;look into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor" rel="noopener noreferrer">U2F keys</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security" class="kg-image" height="720" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/u2f-keys.jpg" width="720" /></figure><p>I believe U2F support is still too immature at the moment, particularly on mobile, for this to be practical for the average person right now. But if you do happen to fall into those groups that will be under attack, you&#xa0;<em>absolutely</em>&#xa0;want to set up U2F keys where you can today. They&#x2019;re cheap, and the good news is that they&#xa0;<em>literally make phishing impossible</em>&#xa0;at last. Given that Google had&#xa0;100% company-wide <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/google-security-keys-neutralized-employee-phishing/" rel="noopener noreferrer">success against phishing with U2F</a>, we know this works.</p><p>In today&#x2019;s world, computers are now so omnipresent that there is no longer any such thing as cybersecurity, online security, or computer security &#x2013; there&#x2019;s only&#xa0;<em>security</em>. You either have it, or you don&#x2019;t. If you follow and share these three rules, hopefully you too can have a modicum of security today.</p>'}]}

For a long time, that was fine, that was enough; that was all I needed. But along the way I never felt that <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/please-dont-learn-to-code/" rel="noreferrer">being a programmer</a> was this&#xa0;unambiguously great-for-everyone career field with zero downsides. There are absolutely occupational hazards of being a programmer, and&#xa0;<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/your-favorite-programming-quote/">one of my favorite programming quotes</a>&#xa0;is an allusion to one of them:</p><blockquote>It should be noted that no ethically-trained software engineer would ever consent to write a&#xa0;<code>DestroyBaghdad</code>&#xa0;procedure. Basic professional ethics would instead require him to write a&#xa0;<code>DestroyCity</code>&#xa0;procedure, to which Baghdad could be given as a parameter.</blockquote><p>Which reminds me of&#xa0;another <a href="https://waxy.org/2015/12/tracking_the_trump_is_a_comment_section_running_for_president_joke/" rel="noopener noreferrer">joke people were telling in 2015</a>:</p><blockquote>Donald Trump is basically a comment section running for president</blockquote><p>Which is troubling because technically,&#xa0;<em>technically</em>, I run a <a href="https://discourse.org/" rel="noreferrer">company that&#xa0;builds comment sections</a>.</p><p>Here at the tail end of 2017, from where I sit neither of these jokes seem particularly funny to me any more. Perhaps I have lost the capacity to feel joy as a human being?&#xa0;<em>Haha just kidding!... kinda.</em></p><p>Remember&#xa0;in 2011&#xa0;when Marc Andreeseen said that &#x201c;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460" rel="noreferrer">Software is eating the world</a>&#x201d;?</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="To Serve Man, with Software" class="kg-image" height="400" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/12/software-is-eating-the-world-marc-andreessen.jpg" width="850" /></figure><p>That used to sound all hip and cool and inspirational, like &#x201c;Wow! We software developers really&#xa0;<em>are</em>&#xa0;making a difference in the world!&#x201d; and now for the life of me I can&#x2019;t read it as anything other than an ominous warning that we just weren&#x2019;t smart enough to translate properly at the time. But&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Serve_Man_(The_Twilight_Zone)" rel="noopener noreferrer">maybe now we are</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="To Serve Man, with Software" class="kg-image" height="900" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-33.png" width="1199" /></figure><p>I&#x2019;ve said many, many times that the key to becoming an experienced software developer is to understand that you are, at all times,&#xa0;<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/on-the-meaning-of-coding-horror/">your own worst enemy</a>. I don&#x2019;t mean this in a negative way &#x2013; you have to constantly plan for and design around your inevitable human mistakes and fallibility. It&#x2019;s fundamental to good software engineering because, well, we&#x2019;re all human. The good-slash-bad news is that you&#x2019;re only&#xa0;<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-trap-you-set-for-yourself/"><em>accidentally</em><u>&#xa0;</u>out to get yourself</a>. But what happens when we&#x2019;re infinitely connected and software is suddenly&#xa0;<em>everywhere</em>, in everyone&#x2019;s pockets every moment of the day, starting to approximate a natural extension of our bodies? All of a sudden those little collective social software accidents become <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-other-tech-bubble/" rel="noreferrer">considerably more dangerous</a>:</p><blockquote>The issue is bigger than any single scandal, I told him. As headlines have exposed the troubling inner workings of company after company, startup culture no longer feels like fodder for gentle parodies about ping pong and hoodies. It feels ugly and rotten. Facebook, the greatest startup success story of this era, isn&#x2019;t a merry band of hackers building cutesy tools that allow you to digitally Poke your friends. It&#x2019;s a powerful and potentially sinister collector of personal data, a propaganda partner to government censors, and an enabler of discriminatory advertising.</blockquote><p>I&#x2019;m reminded of a particular Mitchell and Webb skit:&#xa0;&#x201c;<em>Are we the baddies?&#x201d;</em></p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>On the topic of unanticipated downsides to technology, there is no show more essential than&#xa0;<a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/70264888" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Mirror</a>. If you haven&#x2019;t watched Black Mirror yet, do not pass go, do not collect $200, go immediately to Netflix and watch it. Go on! Go ahead!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><blockquote>&#x26a0; <strong>Fair warning:</strong> please DO NOT start with season 1 episode 1 of Black Mirror! Start with season 3, and go forward. If you like those, dip into season 2 and the just-released season 4, then the rest. But humor me and please at least watch the first episode of season 3.</blockquote><p>The technology described in Black Mirror can be fanciful at times, but several episodes portray disturbingly plausible scenarios with&#xa0;<em>today&#x2019;s</em>&#xa0;science and tech, much less what we&#x2019;ll have 20 to 50 years from now. These are very real cautionary tales, and some of this stuff is well on its way toward being realized.</p><p>Programmers don&#x2019;t think of themselves as people with the power to change the world. Most programmers I know, including myself, grew up as nerds, geeks, social outcasts. Did I ever tell you about the time I wrote a self-destructing Apple // boot disk program to let a girl in middle school know that I liked her? I was (and still am) a terrible programmer, but oh man did I ever test the heck out of&#xa0;<em>that</em>&#xa0;code before copying on to her school floppy disc. But I digress. What do you do when you wake up one day and software&#xa0;<em>has</em>&#xa0;kind of eaten the world, and&#xa0;<strong>it is no longer clear if software is in fact an unambiguously good thing, like we thought, like everyone told us&#x2026; like we&#xa0;<em>wanted it to be?</em></strong></p><p>Months ago I submitted a brief interview for a&#xa0;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1465462333/" rel="noreferrer">children&#x2019;s book about coding</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="To Serve Man, with Software" class="kg-image" height="768" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-34.png" width="598" /></figure><p>I recently received a complimentary copy of the book in the mail. I paged to&#xa0;<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/12/dk-findout-coding-page-50.jpg">my short interview</a>, alongside the very cool&#xa0;<a href="http://www.prottsman.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kiki Prottsman</a>. I had no real recollection of the interview questions after the months of lead time it takes to print a physical book, but reading the printed page, I suddenly hit myself over the head with the very answer I had been searching my soul for these past 6 months:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="To Serve Man, with Software" class="kg-image" height="201" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-35.png" width="655" /></figure><p>In attempting to simplify my answers for an audience of kids, I had concisely articulated the one thing that keeps me coming back to software:&#xa0;<strong>to serve man</strong>. Not on a platter, for bullshit monetization &#x2013; but <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-just-in-time-theory/" rel="noreferrer">software that&#xa0;helps people</a>&#xa0;be the best version of themselves.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>And you know why I do it? I need that help, too. I get tired, angry, upset, emotional, cranky, irritable, frustrated and I need to be reminded from time to time to choose to be the better version of myself. I don&#x2019;t always succeed. But&#xa0;<em>I want to</em>. And I believe everyone else &#x2013; for some reasonable statistical value of everyone else &#x2013; fundamentally does, too.</p><p>That was the not-so-secret design philosophy behind Stack Overflow, that&#xa0;<strong>by helping others become better programmers, you too would become a better programmer</strong>. It&#x2019;s unavoidable. And, even better, if we leave enough helpful breadcrumbs behind for those that follow us,&#xa0;<em>we collectively advance the whole of programming for everyone</em>.</p><p>I apologize for not blogging much in 2017. I&#x2019;ve certainly been busy with Discourse which is actually going great; we grew to 21 people and&#xa0;<a href="https://blog.discourse.org/2017/12/discourse-gives-back-2017/" rel="noopener noreferrer">gave $55,000 back</a>&#xa0;this year to the open source ecosystem we build on. But that&#x2019;s no excuse. The truth is that it&#x2019;s been hard to write because this has been a deeply troubling year in so many dimensions &#x2013; for men, for tech, for American democracy. I&#x2019;m ashamed of much that happened, and I think one of the first and most important steps we can take is to&#xa0;<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-hugging-will-continue-until-morale-improves/">embrace explicit codes of conduct</a>&#xa0;throughout our industry. I also continue to believe, if we start to think more holistically about what our software can do to&#xa0;<strong>serve all people</strong>, not just ourselves personally (or, even worse, the company we work for) &#x2013; that software can and should be part of the solution.</p><p>I tried to amplify on these thoughts in recent podcasts:</p>\n<!--kg-card-begin: html-->\n<table><tbody style="margin: 0px;"><tr style="margin: 0px;"><td><img alt="To Serve Man, with Software" height="100" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/12/kim-crayton.jpg" style="margin: 0px; display: block; height: auto;" width="100" /></td><td>&#xa0;<a href="http://www.kimcrayton.com/commengreport-jeff-atwood/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Community Engineering Report</a><span>&#xa0;</span>with Kim Crayton</td></tr><tr style="margin: 0px;"><td><img alt="To Serve Man, with Software" height="100" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/12/dave-rael.jpg" style="margin: 0px; display: block; height: auto;" width="100" /></td><td>&#xa0;<a href="http://developeronfire.com/podcast/episode-258-jeff-atwood-sharing-the-house" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Developer on Fire</a><span>&#xa0;</span>with Dave Rael</td></tr><tr style="margin: 0px;"><td><img alt="To Serve Man, with Software" height="100" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/12/william-channer.jpg" style="margin: 0px; display: block; height: auto;" width="100" /></td><td>&#xa0;<a href="https://drt.fm/jeff-atwood" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dorm Room Tycoon</a><span>&#xa0;</span>with William Channer</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n<p>Software is easy to change, but people... aren&#x2019;t.

Why?</p><p>I\'ll start by talking about my university days. I started as one of 108 students at that university in the chemistry department. By the time I got my diploma (masters degree), there were only 32 of us left. The other 70% had dropped out, having failed too many exams. On the other hand, we paid just 49 bucks in tuition per semester, so while we still had to pay for our cost of living and study materials, the financial burden was a lot lower.

With that mod, I can play the game. And it is a beautiful and interesting game. I am just not sure that it is a good game.<div><br /></div><div>Among TV shows there is a genre called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_box_show" target="_blank">mystery box show</a>, represented by series like Lost or The X-Files. There is an underlying mythos, which is only hinted at at the start, and over time pieces of the puzzle are revealed, while new mysteries spring up. Being mysterious is the very purpose, and the viewer is strung along forever, with the mystery never being fully resolved, or so convoluted that nobody understands it. You can watch all 121 episodes of Lost, and then still need an "Lost ending explained" video on YouTube afterwards. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a mystery box RPG. Strong visuals and even stronger emotional moments make you want to explore the mystery of that world, but it is unlikely that the resolution at the end will actually satisfy you. Not only is the story convoluted, it also turns out to be centered around the characters that you are *not* playing, which I find problematic for a game in which you spend so much time optimizing those characters.

With that mod, I can play the game. And it is a beautiful and interesting game. I am just not sure that it is a good game.<div><br /></div><div>Among TV shows there is a genre called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_box_show" target="_blank">mystery box show</a>, represented by series like Lost or The X-Files. There is an underlying mythos, which is only hinted at at the start, and over time pieces of the puzzle are revealed, while new mysteries spring up. Being mysterious is the very purpose, and the viewer is strung along forever, with the mystery never being fully resolved, or so convoluted that nobody understands it. You can watch all 121 episodes of Lost, and then still need an "Lost ending explained" video on YouTube afterwards. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a mystery box RPG. Strong visuals and even stronger emotional moments make you want to explore the mystery of that world, but it is unlikely that the resolution at the end will actually satisfy you. Not only is the story convoluted, it also turns out to be centered around the characters that you are *not* playing, which I find problematic for a game in which you spend so much time optimizing those characters. But if you don\'t mind the end, and just enjoy the excellent cinematic composition, there is quite some enjoyment to be had in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</div><div><br /></div><div>The weird and beautiful world and its mysterious inhabitants are very interesting.

Videogames are a bit different: People use other words, like complex, or "difficult to learn", to describe a game like Europa Universalis. But calling a videogame just "difficult" in the overwhelming majority of cases means only one thing: The game demanding a very fast reaction time, and you not being able to progress if you aren\'t fast enough.

If the difficulty of a game lies in its complexity, that is something that can be overcome by studying the game. But for reaction time, there is a hard cap, which is biological. I could train reaction time for days, and not get below a certain threshold. And that threshold is age-dependent. The scientific link between age and reaction time is well established, and I as a 60-year old pensioner can\'t possibly beat a teenager in reaction time, regardless of amount of training.

The general assumption, based more on the toy market than on the videogame market, that the audience remains young because older people stop playing, simply isn\'t true.</div><div><br /></div><div>This is further complicated by economic realities. Older people have always had more money than younger people, because they had the time to accumulate wealth or experience that translates into higher salaries. But these days there is an additional effect of rising inequality, which means that a large percentage of young people these days are poorer than previous generations were. Thus we get reports on how <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/video-games-spending-by-young-americans-is-dropping-sharply-report-suggests" target="_blank">video game spending by 18-24 year-old Americans has declined almost 25% over the last year</a>, much more than for older age groups.

It was very obvious to me, even before the discussion on the game\'s difficulty, that I wouldn\'t have the reaction time to enjoy playing this.

That wasn\'t always the case, 40 years ago I finished <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_Miner" target="_blank">Manic Miner</a> on the ZX Spectrum, which was the really, really difficult platformer game of the day.

Before the release of WoT 2.0, estimated player numbers were down to 2.5 million, and we don\'t have numbers yet how much the new version was able to revive.</div><div><br /></div><div>Declining player numbers not only pose a financial problem to Wargaming, the company running the game. It also poses a financial problem to a number of YouTube channels that have dedicated their channel to World of Tanks content. Fewer players means fewer potential viewers, which means less revenue from content creation. And of course the content creators each have their own idea why World of Tanks is declining, and frequently blame Wargaming for some decision or other. This is also somewhat typical for YouTube: If you run a channel for a game and don\'t frequently criticize the game, you will be seen as a shill. Also the occasional <i>"World of Tanks is dying"</i> sensationalist / controversial video is good for viewer numbers, as controversy gets more clicks than <i>"this is fine"</i> content.</div><div><br /></div><div>So while Wargaming was mostly concerned how to monetize the remaining players, many YouTube channels were complaining about that monetization. That went as far as some channels organizing a "boycott", in which they wouldn\'t review the tanks from loot boxes.

Which didn\'t make the content on YouTube about World of Tanks any more positive.</div><div><br /></div><div>World of Tanks has, and always had, a slower pace than other online shooters. Especially with heavier tanks at higher tiers and with players using terrain and cover well, a lot of shots simply didn\'t penetrate armor. Which kept tanks alive longer, and led to matches being up to 15 minutes long. Now on the one side, Wargaming felt that a faster game would attract more players. On the other side, Wargaming wanted to sell stuff to players, like premium tanks and premium ammunition. So over the years, power creep occurred: The tanks today penetrate armor a lot more often, due to players using premium "Pay2Win" features. In addition, one of the major changes in World of Tanks 2.0 is an "armor flashlight", that makes it easier for less experienced players to see where the armor of the enemy is weak and can be penetrated.</div><div><br /></div><div>Between that, and the drive to get players back, or new players into the game, veterans of World of Tanks aren\'t happy: Too many people in a typical battle aren\'t very experienced, and play in a more YOLO style, which has become more viable due to that power creep. Thus battles are now much faster, often last only around 5 minutes, and feel very different to the more careful style the veterans are used to. Thus an increasing number of World of Tank content creators are just ranting about the game these days, which doesn\'t really help to promote it, and contributes to the downward spiral. Which also reduces their own viewer numbers. A video 5 years ago from Quickybaby about the best starting tech tree got 692k views, while an equivalent video from 2 weeks ago about which free tech tree to pick only got 255k views. It is pretty obvious that the World of Tanks ecosystem is not in a good shape. The game company and the content creators all make a lot less money than a few years ago, and often blame each other for that.</div><div><br /></div><div>Undoubtedly related to declining player numbers and the resulting matchmaking problems is the fact that World of Tanks today has a lot more PvE parts than it had 5 years ago, when I played last. Today, unless you turn it off, your first battles every day are PvE battles against bots. And why would you turn that off, when you are more likely to win against bots than against real players, and you get full credits and xp for those wins, they just don\'t affect ranking. There are also a number of PvE events, and a badly defined "new player protection mode", in which new players are again more likely to face bots as enemies, or other newer players, and are protected from "seal clubbing", as the practice of veteran players farming new players for xp and credits was known.</div><div><br /></div><div>But while the increase of PvE actually makes World of Tanks more attractive to me, I don\'t think I will play WoT 2.0 a lot.

Fate is a board game by designer Matt Leacock. Matt got his breakthrough in the board game industry with Pandemic, and has since then made several board games that are variations of the Pandemic system. Z-Man Games even created a trademark for <a href="https://www.zmangames.com/universe/pandemic-system/" target="_blank">Pandemic System</a> games, and added some more games not designed by Matt. There are Pandemic System games with a World of Warcraft theme, a Fall of Rome theme, a Dutch dikes themes, a Cthulhu theme, and Star Wars theme, and now Fate joins them as a Pandemic System game with a The Lord of the Rings theme. So I wasn\'t too impressed on hearing this game being announced, it sounded a lot like yet another milking of the same old cash cow. Then I got to play the game at a board game night, and my attitude changed. I even rushed out to buy a copy.<div><br /></div><div>So, what is the Pandemic System? All games with this system are cooperative board games, where the players together struggle to hold back a growing threat. After every player move, some enemy cards are revealed that make bad things happen. If players aren\'t efficient enough to fight the threats faster than they appear, things go downhill quickly. As a special twist, at some points in the game the already played enemy cards are shuffled and put back on the <b>top</b> of the enemy deck. Which means that some enemy cards you\'ll see repeatedly, concentrating the threat locally, and others not at all.</div><div><br /></div><div>Fate adds a new twist to this system: The enemy (shadow) cards now have two different backs. When you turn over the top shadow card, the back of the next card tells you whether to apply the effect on the top or the bottom. Bottom effects put shadow troops (think orcs) into play, bottom effects move those troops in the direction of some haven. This makes the new system slightly more varied than the standard Pandemic System, and Fate just might be the best Pandemic game just from a pure game mechanics point of view.</div><div><br /></div><div>But the reason I would really recommend Fate as a board game is the theme. Which means that my recommendation is addressed to anybody who has at least a decent knowledge of The Lord of the Rings, either by having read the books, or by having seen the films, or ideally both. We played Fate once with a guy who had no clue who Gandalf was, and he still had fun, but there is a huge amount of additional fun to have if you are somewhat knowledgeable of Tolkien\'s work. On the one side, the growing threat produced by the improved Pandemic System is a perfect fit for the growing threat of Sauron in The Lord of the Rings. Also the group being split up all over the map of Middle Earth is an obvious fit to the story. On the other side of things, the game cleverly references the memorable scenes of the books / movies by turning them into quests. On my first game, I was playing Gandalf the Grey, and I had to go to Moria, confront the Balrog, and come back as Gandalf the White. There is a good selection of different quests for different characters, only Frodo having to throw the One Ring into Mount Doom is always the final quest to win the game. Playing Fate feels a lot like The Lord of the Rings, the theme is extremely well integrated into gameplay, and if you like the theme, it adds a lot to the fun of the game.</div><div><br /></div><div>The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship costs about $80, or slightly cheaper at €65 in Europe. That makes it a lot cheaper than many of the crowdfunded games I own, but still relatively expensive compared to other retail games. My main point of criticism of the game is that it includes a cardboard dice tower; that adds a lot to table presence, but it is somewhat fiddly to put together, and you have to partially disassemble it to put it back into the box. As you often only throw 3 dice or less, it seems like an unnecessary cost element to me, although some other people absolutely love that thing. I like that the characters are screen printed on wooden pieces instead of being plastic miniatures. The allied and shadow troops are a bit on the small side. But kudos to Asmodee, who without fuzz agreed to send me a replacement for a damaged dwarven troop in my copy of the game.</div><div><br /></div><div>Personally I like the cooperative nature of Fate, and its variability. But there being no hidden information opens the game up to the risk of one alpha gamer trying to boss around everybody else at the table to do what he says. Fate needs cooperation, but one needs to balance that with the need for player agency. I guess it depends very much on your gaming group. A group that is working very well together can potentially play Fate at a higher player count of 4 or 5; for most groups 2 or 3 players is probably safer. Also a matter of personal preference is your acceptance of luck in a game. Random characters having to do random quests means that different games can be very different in difficulty; the random nature of the shadow cards can also produce spikes of difficulty, or just ruin your plans by a bad luck draw. On the positive side, this keeps Fate very interesting, you aren\'t going to get to a situation where you feel you have already won only half way through the game.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>'}], 'summary': 'Winning the award for the board game with the most unwieldy title this year, I\'ll call&nbsp;<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/436217/the-lord-of-the-rings-fate-of-the-fellowship" target="_blank">The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship</a> just Fate for the rest of this post.

On the positive side, this keeps Fate very interesting, you aren\'t going to get to a situation where you feel you have already won only half way through the game.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>', 'links': [{'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/feeds/5484888468973093854/comments/default', 'title': 'Post Comments'}, {'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/5584578/5484888468973093854', 'title': '0 Comments'}, {'rel': 'edit', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/5484888468973093854'}, {'rel': 'self', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/5484888468973093854'}, {'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2025/09/the-lord-of-rings-fate-of-fellowship.html', 'title': 'The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'author': 'Tobold (noreply@blogger.com)', 'gd_image': {'rel': 'http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail', 'width': '32', 'height': '32', 'src': '//blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuM2C_Q8Unm48KFjOhhIlL6cXY_BsaPP_9V4MPjh-3titjEOTbbjHrUhJCRlIyRCKynCwAmVzZZdPDA34cXvAWFAH39LCloM3L_I8MuLIZvr0qbPfplh-5TGqKpq813gMY9cbh5tQ-yySfKmDHWbEjMPL-OQZnpnzO2tbdvDkcnUUiSic/s220/Tobold.jpg'}, 'thr_total': '0'}

They envision a future with elements from films like The Terminator, or A Space Odyssey, where AI becomes self-aware, super-intelligent, and intent on oppressing or wiping out humans. I don\'t think any of that will happen during my lifetime, armed robots simply aren\'t really a thing yet. In 2025 there is a possibility, albeit a small one, that you get killed by an AI-driven car. But we don\'t even have enough data, enough widespread adoption, and enough standardized AI driving technology that we could even say whether an AI driver kills more or less people than a human driver. The large language model generative AI from software like ChatGPT can kill people indirectly by causing mental harm, e.g. encouraging suicide, but that is still very far from a Terminator future.<div><br /></div><div>In the medium term, a much more realistic fear of AI is that of a disruption of the jobs market through artificial intelligence. The nature of work will change somewhat if companies move towards a wider adoption of AI. New jobs will emerge, but some old jobs will disappear. If you never heard anybody describing his job as "Vibe Coding Cleanup Specialist", that is because that job didn\'t exist before AI. Today it does, but the company hiring him is probably hiring fewer regular coders.</div><div><br /></div><div>I believe there is a much bigger short term risk of AI, but I will have to precede my thoughts with a "this is not financial advice" disclaimer. Stock markets are at an all time high. The S&amp;P 500 is now over 40% tech stocks, and most of those tech stocks are heavily invested in artificial intelligence. There is at least a non-zero probability that there is an AI bubble, that investors overestimated the gains companies can make with AI over the coming years, and that the bubble could burst when these gains don\'t get realized as fast as they thought. How does that work?</div><div><br /></div><div>What one needs to understand is the concept of market capitalization, market cap for short. For example Nvidia has&nbsp;24.4 billion shares outstanding, and these shares today trade at $177.75. If you multiply these two numbers, you get the Nvidia market cap of $4.3 trillion. The problem with the concept is that this is imaginary money. It would be impossible to exchange 24.4 billion shares of Nvidia for $4.3 trillion in cash, because the act of selling Nvidia shares would make the share price drop. The same is true for every other share. As long as more people want to buy these shares than there are for sale, stock prices rise. As soon as people want to sell and cash in, stock prices drop. If you bought Nvidia shares on January 1st 2023 for under $15 and sell them now for $177, you made a huge profit. If you buy Nvidia shares for $177 now, and in a year the stock price dropped by half, you would lose money on selling.</div><div><br /></div><div>Fundamentally, stock prices are correlated to what investors think the future of a company will look like. Recently OpenAI made a deal with Oracle to invest $300 billion in AI data centers built by Oracle. This raised the stock price of Oracle, but also of Nvidia, where Oracle would buy the chips for those data centers. If everything in this deal happens as announced, Oracle and Nvidia are expected to have higher revenue, and thus their stock prices rose on an expectation of that. But the future is uncertain, and this optimistic expectation of the future might just be plain wrong. OpenAI is actually losing money every year, and the $300 billion would have to come from investors. And then there is the practical difficulty of buying and powering that many data centers in just a few years. Once Nvidia has made the chips, sold them to Oracle, and Oracle has built the data centers, OpenAI still needs to figure out how to turn that $300 billion investment into a profitable revenue stream. With AI adoption by non-tech companies apparently slowing down, all that future profit isn\'t obvious.</div><div><br /></div><div>I believe that stock markets are failing to price in the unintended consequences of the AI boom. For example, a lot of Americans have noticed their electricity prices going up, especially in regions where data centers have been built. Electricity is a regionally traded commodity, and if a lot of new electricity consumers go live, supply doesn\'t go up as fast as demand, and prices generally rise. That is a problem for AI data center owners, but also of all other industry using electricity, and of regular households.</div><div><br /></div><div>Another "unintended" consequence of AI is more unemployment. Where do the stock markets think the profits from AI will ultimately come from? The most straightforward way for a general company to make money with AI is to replace people by it, paying less for an "AI worker" than for the person who did the same job before. But if everybody has "lower labor cost", it also means that a lot of people are unemployed or earn a lot less. And these people are the customers for the companies on the stock market. We already see companies like McDonalds struggling because many of their customers are lower income households, and can\'t afford fast food anymore. If you directly translate aggregate lower labor cost into aggregate lower consumer spending, the future for some companies on the stock market looks a lot less rosy. Those aren\'t necessarily the same companies, e.g. Oracle does very little business with low income households. But right now a glorious AI future, whether it will happen or not, has already been priced into the stock price of the companies that might gain from it, and not yet into the stock price of the companies that would be at the losing end of that deal. I don\'t see McDonalds replacing a lot of its staff by AI, as AI isn\'t yet very good at flipping burgers.</div><div><br /></div><div>Investor optimism leads to overpriced stocks.&nbsp;"Irrational exuberance" in the words of Alan Greenspan. The price to earnings ratio of Nvidia is over 50, that of Oracle over 75. The historical average P/E ratio for the S&amp;P 500 is between 10 and 20.&nbsp;Current S&amp;P 500 PE Ratio is over 30. So the most short term risk from artificial intelligence is not some version of the Terminator, but what is politely called a "stock market correction", where investors realize that AI isn\'t going to pay out *that* fast, and stock prices drop a lot, because suddenly more people are trying to sell their overpriced AI shares than there are people wanting to buy them. And that also affects people who simply invested in ETFs, or who have money in a 401k pension plan. That is not to say that AI isn\'t a technology that will make money in the future, it just might take longer, or the profits will go to different companies than investors think today. Just like the dot com bubble burst, and the internet is doing fine, the AI bubble can burst while AI still has a bright future.

Especially games that don\'t just sell on artistic appeal, but on gameplay. We don\'t need to live in a world where half of the indie games are using pixel art. And I am sure that generative AI could also be used to turn interesting art from human artists into video game animations at much lower cost than today. I would rather see games competing on their merits on platforms like Steam without the gatekeeping of big budget artwork.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>', 'links': [{'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/feeds/6126267731058331676/comments/default', 'title': 'Post Comments'}, {'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/5584578/6126267731058331676', 'title': '3 Comments'}, {'rel': 'edit', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/6126267731058331676'}, {'rel': 'self', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/6126267731058331676'}, {'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2025/09/the-gatekeeping-of-big-budgets.html', 'title': 'The gatekeeping of big budgets'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'author': 'Tobold (noreply@blogger.com)', 'gd_image': {'rel': 'http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail', 'width': '32', 'height': '32', 'src': '//blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuM2C_Q8Unm48KFjOhhIlL6cXY_BsaPP_9V4MPjh-3titjEOTbbjHrUhJCRlIyRCKynCwAmVzZZdPDA34cXvAWFAH39LCloM3L_I8MuLIZvr0qbPfplh-5TGqKpq813gMY9cbh5tQ-yySfKmDHWbEjMPL-OQZnpnzO2tbdvDkcnUUiSic/s220/Tobold.jpg'}, 'thr_total': '3'}

Not the chance to get struck by lightning, it is around that number, although it obviously depends a lot on where and how you live. A link between carrying a mobile phone and getting cancer has been discussed, but the chance to get cancer is higher than the chance to get struck by lightning, and the possible increase to that chance is so low as to be considered not scientifically proven. Right now, in the EU official classification, mobile phones are in the same category of increased cancer risk as pickles.

This week in the news is a possible link between the use of Tylenol during pregnancy and the child being born with autism. In the United States the probability of a child being born with autism is estimated to be 1 in 36. That is certainly higher than a century ago, but it is unclear whether this is due to external factors like Tylenol, or simply to an increased awareness of autism. Now there are scientific studies that link Tylenol to autism, and there are scientific studies that show no such link. Just as there are scientific studies that link glyphosate to&nbsp;non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and there being scientific studies that show no such link.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The difference now being that these things have been politicised, and in the USA a Republican would be more likely to believe in the link between Tylenol and autism, while a Democrat would be more likely to believe in the link between glyphosate and&nbsp;non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It should be obvious that this isn\'t how probability or science works. But humans are notoriously bad with probabilities. And thus anything that science would consider to be an event of low probability can find its way into our belief systems. If you thought my example of a mobile phone getting you struck by lightning was ridiculous, how about the belief that it was your sins that would get you struck by lightning? That was pretty wide spread in humanity over many different cultures and religions. And our belief systems are evolving away from being religious to being political. Especially in two-party systems like the USA, party affiliation today has a stronger influence on what you believe to be true than your religious affiliation.</div><div><br /></div><div>For all questions of "does product X causes undesirable outcome Y", I would urge you to consider that whatever you read might be a result of political bias. You still should ask the relevant scientific question of how high the probability of undesirable outcome X is with and without product X. How strong or weak is the link? If the probability is relatively high to start with, and increases only by a small amount, how justified would it be to sue the producer of product X for damages? Although in a legal system where the probability of getting over 1 million dollars in a lawsuit is higher than the probability of winning 1 million dollars in the lottery, scientific proof is maybe the last thing you want.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>'}], 'summary': 'Imagine that your probability of getting struck by lightning is 1 in a million in a given year.

Just as there are scientific studies that link glyphosate to&nbsp;non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and there being scientific studies that show no such link.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The difference now being that these things have been politicised, and in the USA a Republican would be more likely to believe in the link between Tylenol and autism, while a Democrat would be more likely to believe in the link between glyphosate and&nbsp;non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It should be obvious that this isn\'t how probability or science works. But humans are notoriously bad with probabilities. And thus anything that science would consider to be an event of low probability can find its way into our belief systems. If you thought my example of a mobile phone getting you struck by lightning was ridiculous, how about the belief that it was your sins that would get you struck by lightning? That was pretty wide spread in humanity over many different cultures and religions. And our belief systems are evolving away from being religious to being political. Especially in two-party systems like the USA, party affiliation today has a stronger influence on what you believe to be true than your religious affiliation.</div><div><br /></div><div>For all questions of "does product X causes undesirable outcome Y", I would urge you to consider that whatever you read might be a result of political bias. You still should ask the relevant scientific question of how high the probability of undesirable outcome X is with and without product X. How strong or weak is the link? If the probability is relatively high to start with, and increases only by a small amount, how justified would it be to sue the producer of product X for damages? Although in a legal system where the probability of getting over 1 million dollars in a lawsuit is higher than the probability of winning 1 million dollars in the lottery, scientific proof is maybe the last thing you want.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>', 'links': [{'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/feeds/4166210046328438336/comments/default', 'title': 'Post Comments'}, {'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/5584578/4166210046328438336', 'title': '6 Comments'}, {'rel': 'edit', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/4166210046328438336'}, {'rel': 'self', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/4166210046328438336'}, {'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2025/09/science-probability-and-political-bias.html', 'title': 'Science, probability and political bias'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'author': 'Tobold (noreply@blogger.com)', 'gd_image': {'rel': 'http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail', 'width': '32', 'height': '32', 'src': '//blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuM2C_Q8Unm48KFjOhhIlL6cXY_BsaPP_9V4MPjh-3titjEOTbbjHrUhJCRlIyRCKynCwAmVzZZdPDA34cXvAWFAH39LCloM3L_I8MuLIZvr0qbPfplh-5TGqKpq813gMY9cbh5tQ-yySfKmDHWbEjMPL-OQZnpnzO2tbdvDkcnUUiSic/s220/Tobold.jpg'}, 'thr_total': '6'}

In the first story mission we ended up in a situation where we were boxed in and couldn\'t move, and as it took several rounds to kill an enemy we had a series of rather boring turns. The second and third story mission we both lost, and couldn\'t replay because of the fail forward system. In both those mission the objective tokens were randomly distributed on the map, and we just had bad luck of them being in the worst possible spots in both cases.

It does not help you to know that at the start of EU4 it is a possible strategy to give away all your crownland to the estates in exchange for one monarch point per category per month, as EU5 doesn\'t even have monarch points. It is very likely that EU5 will have some systems in place that address the same fundamentals, e.g. a system that prevents you from having too many alliances.

Games like Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild / Tears of the Kingdom have relatively open worlds, but still provide the player with a clear path of progression and a main story line. That might actually be an optimum. If you get much more open, the player is increasingly likely to feel somewhat lost and aimless. It is a lot easier to follow a set of goals that is prescribed by the game than to set your own goals and follow those.<div><br /></div><div>I very much like the board game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/420033/vantage" target="_blank">Vantage</a> that recently came out. Having a lot of fun playing that occasionally with my wife, played some solo, and brought it several times to board game night. But Vantage sure isn\'t for everybody. Dice Tower made a video review, in which 2 of the 4 reviewers rated it very highly, while the 2 others didn\'t want to play that game again. As a game in which you follow the goals set by the game to win, Vantage doesn\'t work very well. It is more of a very open sandbox game in which you have to pursue your own goals, and the missions and destinies are just sprinkled in as optional content. If you get the concept of "winning" out of your head, Vantage becomes a much better game.</div><div><br /></div><div>I was thinking about that when reading the Reddit discussion on Europa Universalis V. One of the big changes from EU4 to EU5 is that the mission trees that are currently in EU4 have been abandoned. People liked the mission trees, because they provided a clear path to victory. On the one side they gave you specific goals to pursue, on the other side they rewarded you with bonuses, often in the form of permanent claims, that helped you on the way to the next goal. The downside of that is that the mission tree turns a country into a nearly linear experience towards winning the game. And winning Europa Universalis isn\'t much fun to begin with.</div><div><br /></div><div>I recently had a very weird game in which I wanted to try to play France for the first time. But having played countries nearby, and watched some videos, I was well aware of the two major events that happen to France, and the French mission tree. So by maximum use of the advance knowledge and a bit of luck I first exploited the Surrender of Maine event to crush England, and then finagled my way into the Burgundian Succession. Then when the Holy Roman Empire demanded the lowlands, I refused, and crushed Austria. Shortly after Marie of Burgundy had her "riding accident" event, and Burgundy got integrated into France. I also integrated all the apanages. Before I even reached the year 1500, my main problem was that the game couldn\'t find any other rival than Spain for me, I had simply grown too strong too fast. I stopped playing, because it got boring. I know that some people play EU4 with a goal of world conquest, but once you are already the strongest nation, that is just boring to me. I might play France again and just pretend I don\'t know about the events that will happen with England and Burgundy.</div><div><br /></div><div>With the EU4 mission trees telling you how to win and helping you with it, the devs from Paradox decided to not provide such a clear path towards victory for the countries in Europa Universalis V. From all I see, I believe that EU5, like Vantage, will best played without thinking of winning. It could be a lot of fun as an alternative history simulation game. But the different countries you can choose are clearly not equally strong, and very soon people will learn how to conquer the world, especially when starting with a stronger nation. I\'m not sure that will be fun to me, I don\'t rate the combat system of Europa Universalis high enough that I would want to play it as a war game.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>'}], 'summary': 'A lot of games which people think of as being sandboxes in fact aren\'t. Games like Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild / Tears of the Kingdom have relatively open worlds, but still provide the player with a clear path of progression and a main story line. That might actually be an optimum. If you get much more open, the player is increasingly likely to feel somewhat lost and aimless. It is a lot easier to follow a set of goals that is prescribed by the game than to set your own goals and follow those.<div><br /></div><div>I very much like the board game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/420033/vantage" target="_blank">Vantage</a> that recently came out. Having a lot of fun playing that occasionally with my wife, played some solo, and brought it several times to board game night. But Vantage sure isn\'t for everybody. Dice Tower made a video review, in which 2 of the 4 reviewers rated it very highly, while the 2 others didn\'t want to play that game again. As a game in which you follow the goals set by the game to win, Vantage doesn\'t work very well. It is more of a very open sandbox game in which you have to pursue your own goals, and the missions and destinies are just sprinkled in as optional content. If you get the concept of "winning" out of your head, Vantage becomes a much better game.</div><div><br /></div><div>I was thinking about that when reading the Reddit discussion on Europa Universalis V. One of the big changes from EU4 to EU5 is that the mission trees that are currently in EU4 have been abandoned. People liked the mission trees, because they provided a clear path to victory. On the one side they gave you specific goals to pursue, on the other side they rewarded you with bonuses, often in the form of permanent claims, that helped you on the way to the next goal. The downside of that is that the mission tree turns a country into a nearly linear experience towards winning the game. And winning Europa Universalis isn\'t much fun to begin with.</div><div><br /></div><div>I recently had a very weird game in which I wanted to try to play France for the first time. But having played countries nearby, and watched some videos, I was well aware of the two major events that happen to France, and the French mission tree. So by maximum use of the advance knowledge and a bit of luck I first exploited the Surrender of Maine event to crush England, and then finagled my way into the Burgundian Succession. Then when the Holy Roman Empire demanded the lowlands, I refused, and crushed Austria. Shortly after Marie of Burgundy had her "riding accident" event, and Burgundy got integrated into France. I also integrated all the apanages. Before I even reached the year 1500, my main problem was that the game couldn\'t find any other rival than Spain for me, I had simply grown too strong too fast. I stopped playing, because it got boring. I know that some people play EU4 with a goal of world conquest, but once you are already the strongest nation, that is just boring to me. I might play France again and just pretend I don\'t know about the events that will happen with England and Burgundy.</div><div><br /></div><div>With the EU4 mission trees telling you how to win and helping you with it, the devs from Paradox decided to not provide such a clear path towards victory for the countries in Europa Universalis V. From all I see, I believe that EU5, like Vantage, will best played without thinking of winning. It could be a lot of fun as an alternative history simulation game. But the different countries you can choose are clearly not equally strong, and very soon people will learn how to conquer the world, especially when starting with a stronger nation.

This makes sense, as a proper compiler library will channel the efforts of contributors into building developer tools, which in turn, will increase the adoption rate of the language. However, progress on this topic has been slow, mainly due to two aspects: (1) the lack of a clear direction, and (2) the intimidating complexity of the DMD frontend, which requires significant work on the compiler codebase.</p>\n<p>The good news is that we now have a plan, which I will outline in this blog post. The bad news is that implementing this plan requires significant effort, and we need more contributors. However, the silver lining is that the work, while extensive, mostly involves refactoring the code. This provides an excellent opportunity for contributors to familiarize themselves with the compiler codebase while delivering real value. Before delving into the specifics, let me give you some background.</p>\n<h2 id="currentstatusandhowwegothere">Current Status And How We Got Here</h2>\n<p>To fully understand the work done so far on the compiler-as-a-library project, I highly recommend watching <a href="https://youtu.be/eKT3MYpRgYA?si=FwY84BMXYGLtpGgQ">my talk</a> on this subject.</p>\n<p>In summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Several years ago, we began packaging the compiler as a library.</li>\n<li>Our goal was to clearly separate compilation phases: lexing, parsing, semantic analysis, optimizations, and code generation.</li>\n<li>The parsing and semantic analysis modules were interdependent, necessitating a method for separation.</li>\n<li>We opted to template the parser with an ASTFamily template parameter, defining the AST nodes required for parsing.</li>\n<li>We created ASTBase (containing AST nodes essential for parsing) and ASTCodegen (containing AST nodes needed for code generation).</li>\n<li>ASTBase, as it stands, is code duplicated from ASTCodegen.</li>\n<li>We started extracting semantic routines and fields from AST nodes to eliminate ASTBase&#8217;s code duplication by importing a subset of modules used by ASTCodegen.</li>\n<li>Additionally, we began replacing third-party libraries (like <a href="https://github.com/dlang-community/libdparse/tree/master/src">libdparse</a>) with the DMD-as-a-library package.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more detailed information on each of these points, I recommend watching <a href="https://youtu.be/eKT3MYpRgYA?si=FwY84BMXYGLtpGgQ">the talk</a> I referenced.</p>\n<p>Recently, I proposed to Walter a modification to the codebase that would significantly enhance the flexibility of the compiler library, allowing any AST node to be overwritten. Walter was hesitant to accept my proposal, concerned about the potential &#8220;ugliness&#8221; it would introduce to the codebase. He cited the addition of ASTBase and the resulting code duplication as a precedent. He then suggested that if we eliminate ASTBase, he would reconsider my proposal.</p>\n<h2 id="whatyoucandotohelp">What You Can Do To Help</h2>\n<p>We are now focused on eliminating the duplication in ASTBase. To achieve this, we need to extract all information related to semantic analysis from the existing AST nodes. The challenge is the sheer number of AST nodes and the multitude of functions associated with each. I have been working on this sporadically over the past few months, and progress is slow due to the nature of the work: it mostly involves moving code, creating visitors, breaking dependencies, etc. While not overly complex, it isn&#8217;t particularly creative work either. However, for someone interested in understanding a real-life compiler codebase, it&#8217;s an ideal starting point.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re willing to support this initiative, I&#8217;ve put together <a href="https://github.com/dlang/dmd/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#refactoring-the-dmd-ast">a guide on where to start and what you can do</a>. Feel free to contact me on Slack (razvan.nitu), Discord, or email (razvan.nitu1305@gmail.com) for more details or to request a review of your PR.</p>\n<p>I see this as an excellent opportunity to onboard new people into compiler development in a way that benefits both the language and the contributor. So, if you have some spare time, please join us in getting this work done!</p>'}]}

This article illustrates many simple methods of making your code self-evident and much easier to understand and maintain</p>\n<p>To let you know what you’re fightin’ for, allow me to introduce this little gem I wrote back in 1987:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-c_cpp">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#define O1O printf\n#define OlO putchar\n#define O10 exit\n#define Ol0 strlen\n#define QLQ fopen\n#define OlQ fgetc\n#define O1Q abs\n#define QO0 for\ntypedef char lOL;\n\nlOL*QI[] = {&quot;Use:\\012\\011dump file\\012&quot;,&quot;Unable to open file \'\\x25s\'\\012&quot;,\n  &quot;\\012&quot;,&quot;   &quot;,&quot;&quot;};\n\nmain(I,Il)\nlOL*Il[];\n{       FILE *L;\n         unsigned lO;\n         int Q,OL[\' \'^\'0\'],llO = EOF,\n\n         O=1,l=0,lll=O+O+O+l,OQ=056;\n         lOL*llL=&quot;%2x &quot;;\n         (I != 1&lt;&lt;1&amp;&amp;(O1O(QI[0]),O10(1011-1010))),\n         ((L = QLQ(Il[O],&quot;r&quot;))==0&amp;&amp;(O1O(QI[O],Il[O]),O10(O)));\n         lO = I-(O&lt;&lt;l&lt;&lt;O);\n         while (L-l,1)\n         {       QO0(Q = 0L;((Q &amp;~(0x10-O))== l);\n                         OL[Q++] = OlQ(L));\n                 if (OL[0]==llO) break;\n                 O1O(&quot;\\0454x: &quot;,lO);\n                 if (I == (1&lt;&lt;1))\n                 {       QO0(Q=Ol0(QI[O&lt;&lt;O&lt;&lt;1]);Q&lt;Ol0(QI[0]);\n                         Q++)O1O((OL[Q]!=llO)?llL:QI[lll],OL[Q]);/*&quot;\n                         O10(QI[1O])*/\n                         O1O(QI[lll]);{}\n                 }\n                 QO0 (Q=0L;Q&lt;1&lt;&lt;1&lt;&lt;1&lt;&lt;1&lt;&lt;1;Q+=Q&lt;0100)\n                 {       (OL[Q]!=llO)? /* 0010 10lOQ 000LQL */\n                         ((D(OL[Q])==0&amp;&amp;(*(OL+O1Q(Q-l))=OQ)),\n                         OlO(OL[Q])):\n                         OlO(1&lt;&lt;(1&lt;&lt;1&lt;&lt;1)&lt;&lt;1);\n                 }\n                 O1O(QI[01^10^9]);\n                 lO+=Q+0+l;}\n         }\n         D(l) { return l&gt;=\' \'&amp;&amp;l&lt;=\'\\~\';\n}\n</pre>\n<p>Yes, this is how we wrote C code back then. I even <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/winners.html">won an award</a> for it!</p>\n<p>Although I am a very slow learner, I do learn over time, and gradually the code got better. You’re probably having the same issues with your code. (Or the code written by coworkers, as I agree that <em>your</em> code certainly does not need improvement!)</p>\n<p>This article is about techniques that will help make code self-evident. You are probably already doing some of them. I bet there are some you aren&#8217;t. I also am sure you’re going to argue with me about some of them. Trust me, you’re wrong! If you don’t agree with me now, you will if you’re still programming five years hence.</p>\n<p>I know you’re busy, so let’s jump right in with an observation:</p>\n<p>“Anybody can write complicated code. It takes genius to write simple code.”</p>\n<p>or, if you prefer:</p>\n<p>“The highest accolade your code can garner is: oh pshaw, anybody could have<br />\nwritten that!”</p>\n<p>For example, since I started as an aerospace engineer:</p>\n<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3146" height="1600" src="https://dlang.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lever.jpg" width="1066" /></p>\n<p>consider this lever commonly found in aircraft cockpits. No fair if you already know what it does. Examine it casually. What is it for?</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>It raises and lowers the landing gear. What’s the clue? It’s got a little tire for a knob! Pull the lever up, and the gear gets sucked up. Push it down, the gear goes down. Is that self-evident or what? It’s a masterpiece of simplicity. It doesn’t even need any labels. If the cockpit is filled with smoke, or you&#8217;re focused on what&#8217;s outside the window, your hand knows immediately it’s on the gear lever&mdash;not the flaps or the throttles or the copilot’s ejection seat (just kidding). This kind of stupid simple control is what cockpit designers strive for because pulling the right lever is literally a life-and-death decision. I mean <em>literally</em> in the literal sense of the word.</p>\n<p>This is what we desperately want to achieve in programming. Stupid simple. We’ll probably fail, but the closer the better.</p>\n<p>Diving in&#8230;</p>\n<h3 id="justshootmenow">Just Shoot Me Now</h3>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-c_cpp">#define BEGIN {\n#define END   }</pre>\n<p>Believe it or not, this was common C practice back in the 1980s. It falls into the category of &#8220;Don’t try to make your new language look like your previous language&#8221;. This problem appears in multiple guises. I still tend to name variables in Fortran style from back when the oceans hadn’t yet formed. Before moving to D, I realized that using C macros to invent a personal custom language on top of C was an abomination. Removing it and replacing it with ordinary C code was a big improvement in clarity.</p>\n<h3 id="don’treinventbool">Don’t Reinvent bool</h3>\n<p>Learn what bool is and use it as intended. Accept that the following are all the same:</p>\n<table cols="2" rows="5">\n<tr>\n<td>false</td>\n<td>true</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>no</td>\n<td>yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>off</td>\n<td>on</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0 volts</td>\n<td>5 volts</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>And that this makes code unequivocally worse:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">enum { No, Yes };</pre>\n<p>Just use <code>false</code> and <code>true</code>. Done. And BTW,</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-c_cpp">enum { Yes, No };</pre>\n<p>is just an automatic &#8220;no hire&#8221; decision, as <code>if (Yes)</code> will thoroughly confuse everyone. If you&#8217;ve done this, run and fix it before someone curses your entire ancestry.</p>\n<h3 id="horrorsblockedbyd">Horrors Blocked by D</h3>\n<p>D&#8217;s syntax has been designed to prevent some types of coding horrors.</p>\n<h4 id="cregexexpressionswithoperatoroverloading">C++ Regex expressions with operator overloading</h4>\n<p>I’m not even going to link to this. It can be found with diligent searching. What it does is use operator overloading to make ordinary-looking C++ code actually be a regex! It violates the principle that code should not pretend to be in another language. Imagine the inept error messages the compiler will bless you with if there&#8217;s a coding mistake with this. D makes this hard to do by only allowing arithmetic operators to be overloaded, which disallows things like an overloaded unary <code>*</code>.</p>\n<p>(It’s harder, but still possible, to abuse operator overloading in D. But fortunately, making it harder has largely discouraged it.)</p>\n<h4 id="metaprogrammingwithmacros">Metaprogramming with macros</h4>\n<p>Many people have requested macros be added to D. We&#8217;ve resisted this because macros inevitably result in people inventing their own custom, undocumented language layered over D. This makes it impractical for anyone else to make use of this code. In my not-so-humble opinion, macros are the reason why Lisp has never caught on in the mainstream. No Lisper can read anyone else&#8217;s Lisp code.</p>\n<h4 id="cargumentdependentlookup">C++ Argument Dependent Lookup</h4>\n<p>Nobody knows what symbol will actually be found. ADL was added so one could do operator overloading on the left operand. D just has a simple syntax for left or right operand overloading.</p>\n<h4 id="sfinae">SFINAE</h4>\n<p>Nobody knows if SFINAE is in play or not for any particular expression.</p>\n<h4 id="floorwaxortastydesserttopping">Floor Wax or Tasty Dessert Topping</h4>\n<p>This refers to the confusion between a struct being a value type or a reference type or some chimera of both. In D, a struct is a value type and a class is a reference type. To be fair, some people still try to build a D chimera type, but they should be cashiered.</p>\n<h4 id="multipleinheritance">Multiple inheritance</h4>\n<p>Nobody has ever made a convincing case for why this is needed. Things get really nasty when diamond inheritance is used. Pity the next guy and avoid the temptation. D has multiple inheritance for interfaces only, which has proved to be more than adequate.</p>\n<h3 id="codeflow">Code Flow</h3>\n<p>Code should flow from left to right, and top to bottom. Just like how this article is read.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-c_cpp">f() + g() // which executes first?</pre>\n<p>Fortunately, D guarantees a left-to-right ordering (C does not). But what about:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">g(f(e(d(c(b(a))),3)));</pre>\n<p>That executes inside out! Quick, which function call does the <code>3</code> get passed to? D’s Universal Function Call Syntax to the rescue:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">a.b.c.d(3).e.f.g;</pre>\n<p>That&#8217;s the equivalent, but execution flows clearly left-to-right. Is this an extreme example, or the norm?</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">import std.stdio;\nimport std.array;\nimport std.algorithm;\n\nvoid main() {\n     stdin.byLine(KeepTerminator.yes).\n     map!(a =&gt; a.idup).\n     array.\n     sort.\n     copy(stdout.lockingTextWriter());\n}</pre>\n<p>This code reads from <code>stdin</code> by lines, puts the lines in an array, sorts the array, and writes the sorted result to <code>stdout</code>. It doesn’t quite meet our &#8220;stupid simple&#8221; criteria, but it is pretty close. All with a nice flow from left to right and top to bottom.</p>\n<p>The example also nicely segues into the next observation.</p>\n<h3 id="themorecontrolpathsthelessunderstandable">The More Control Paths, the Less Understandable</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Shaw: You know a great deal about computers, don’t you?<br />\nMr. Spock: I know all about them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I submit that:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-c_cpp">version (X)\n     doX();\ndoY();\nif (Z)\n     doZ();</pre>\n<p>is less comprehensible than:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-c_cpp">doX();\ndoY();\ndoZ();</pre>\n<p>What happened to the conditional expressions? Move them to the interiors of <code>doX()</code> and <code>doZ()</code>.</p>\n<p>I know what you’re thinking. &#8220;But Walter, you didn’t eliminate the conditional expressions, you just moved them!&#8221; Quite right, but those conditional expressions properly belong in the functions, rather than enclosing those functions. They are part of the conceptual encapsulation a function provides, so the caller is clean.</p>\n<h3 id="negation">Negation</h3>\n<p>Negation in English:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dr McCoy: We’re trying to help you, Oxmyx.<br />\nBela Oxmyx: Nobody helps nobody but himself.<br />\nMr. Spock: Sir, you are employing a double negative.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cowardly Lion: Not nobody! Not nohow!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Negation in English is often used as emphasis, rather than logical negation. Our perception of negation is fuzzy and fraught with error. This is something propagandists use to smear someone.</p>\n<p>What the propagandist says: &#8220;Bob is not a drunkard!&#8221;</p>\n<p>What the audience hears: &#8220;Bob is a drunkard!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Skilled communicators avoid negation. Savvy programmers do, too. How many times have you overlooked a not operator? I have many times.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">if (!noWay)</pre>\n<p>is inevitably perceived as:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">if (noWay)</pre>\n<p>I mentioned this discovery to my good friend Andrei Alexandrescu. He didn’t buy it. He said I needed research to back it up. I didn’t have any research, but didn’t change my mind (i.e., hubris). Eventually, I did run across a paper that did do such research and came to the same conclusion as my assumption. I excitedly sent it to Andrei, and to his great credit, he conceded defeat, which is why Andrei is an exceptional man (rare is the person who ever concedes defeat!).</p>\n<p>The lesson here is to avoid using negation in identifiers if at all possible.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">if (way)</pre>\n<p>Isn&#8217;t that better?</p>\n<h4 id="dmdsourcecodehallofshame">DMD Source Code Hall of Shame</h4>\n<p>My own code is hardly a paragon of virtue. Some identifiers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>tf.isnothrow</code></li>\n<li><code>IsTypeNoreturn</code></li>\n<li><code>Noaccesscheck</code></li>\n<li><code>Ignoresymbolvisibility</code></li>\n<li><code>Include.notComputed</code></li>\n<li><code>not nothrow</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have no excuse and shall have myself flagellated with a damp cauliflower. Did I say I didn’t like the code I wrote five years ago?</p>\n<p>This leads us to the D <code>version</code> conditional.</p>\n<h3 id="negationandversion">Negation and <code>version</code></h3>\n<p><a href="https://dlang.org/spec/version.html#version-specification">D version conditionals</a> are very simple:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">version ( Identifier )</pre>\n<p><em>Identifier</em> is usually predefined by the compiler or the command line. Only an identifier is allowed&mdash;no negation, AND, OR, or XOR. (Collectively call that <em>version algebra</em>.) Our users often chafe at this restriction, and I get that it&#8217;s difficult to accept the rationale at first. It’s not impossible to do version algebra:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">version (A) { } else {\n    // !A\n}\n\nversion (A) version (B) {\n    // A &amp;&amp; B\n}\n\nversion (A) version = AorB;\nversion (B) version = AorB;\nversion (AorB) {\n     // A || B\n}</pre>\n<p>and so forth. But it’s clumsy and unattractive <em>on purpose</em>. Why would D do such a thing? It’s meant to encourage thinking about versions in a positive manner. Suppose a project has a Windows and an OSX build:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">version (Windows) {\n     ...\n}\nelse version (OSX) {\n     ...\n}\nelse\n     static assert(0, &quot;unsupported operating system&quot;);</pre>\n<p>Isn’t that better than this:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">...\nversion (!Windows){\n...\n}</pre>\n<p>I’ve seen an awful lot of that style in C. It makes it pointlessly difficult to add support for a new operating system. After all, what the heck is the &#8220;not Windows&#8221; operating system? That really narrows things down! The former snippet makes it so much easier.</p>\n<p>Taking this a step further:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">if (A &amp;&amp; B &amp;&amp; C &amp;&amp; D)\n\nif (A || B || C || D)</pre>\n<p>are easy for a human to parse. Encountering:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">\nif (A &amp;&amp; (!B || C))</pre>\n<p>is always like transitioning from smooth asphalt to a cobblestone road. Ugh. I&#8217;ve made mistakes with such constructions all the time. Not only is it hard to even see the <code>!</code>, but it’s still hard to satisfy yourself that it is correct.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, De Morgan’s Theorem can sometimes come to the rescue:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">(!A &amp;&amp; !B) =&gt; !(A || B)\n(!A || !B) =&gt; !(A &amp;&amp; B)</pre>\n<p>It gets rid of one negation. Repeated application can often transform it into a much more easily understood equation while being equally correct.</p>\n<p>Anecdote: When designing digital logic circuits, the NAND gate is more efficient than the AND gate because it has one less transistor. (AND means (A &amp;&amp; B), NAND means !(A &amp;&amp; B)). But humans just stink at crafting bug-free NAND logic. When I worked on the design of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Boolean_Expression_Language">ABEL programming language</a> back in the 1980s, which was for programming Programmable Logic Devices, ABEL would accept input in positive logic. It would use De Morgan’s theorem to automatically convert it to efficient negative logic. The electronics designers loved it.</p>\n<p>To sum up this section, here’s a shameful snippet from Ubuntu’s unistd.h:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-c_cpp">#if defined __USE_BSD || (defined __USE_XOPEN &amp;&amp; !defined __USE_UNIX98)</pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Prof Marvel: I can’t bring it back, I don’t know how it works!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id="castsarebugs">Casts Are Bugs</h3>\n<p>Casts subvert the protections of the typing system. Sometimes you just gotta have them (to implement <code>malloc</code>, for example, the result needs a cast), but far too often they are simply there to correct sloppy misuse of types. Hence, in D casts are done with the keyword <code>cast</code>, not a peculiar syntax, making them easily greppable. It&#8217;s worthwhile to occasionally grep a code base for <code>cast</code> and see if the types can be reworked to eliminate the need for the cast and have the type system working for rather than against you.</p>\n<p>Pull Request: <a href="https://github.com/dlang/dmd/pull/15488">remove some dyncast calls</a></p>\n<h3 id="self-documentingfunctiondeclarations">Self-Documenting Function Declarations</h3>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">char* xyzzy(char* p)</pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Does <code>p</code> modify what it points to?</li>\n<li>Is <code>p</code> returned?</li>\n<li>Does <code>xyzzy</code> free <code>p</code>?</li>\n<li>Does <code>xyzzy</code> save <code>p</code> somewhere, like in a global?</li>\n<li>Does <code>xyzzy</code> throw <code>p</code>?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These crucial bits of information are rarely noted in the documentation for the function. Even worse, the documentation often gets it wrong! What is needed is self-documenting code that is enforced by the compiler. D has attributes to cover this:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">const char* xyzzy(return scope const char* p)</pre>\n<ul>\n<li><code>p</code> doesn’t modify what it points to</li>\n<li><code>p</code> is returned</li>\n<li><code>p</code> is not free’d</li>\n<li><code>xyzzy</code> does not squirrel away a copy of <code>p</code></li>\n<li><code>p</code> is not thrown in an exception</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is all documentation that now isn&#8217;t necessary to write, and the compiler will check its accuracy for you. Yes, it is called &#8220;attribute soup&#8221; for good reason, and takes some getting used to, but it&#8217;s still better than bad documentation, and adding attributes is optional.</p>\n<h3 id="functionargumentsandreturns">Function Arguments and Returns</h3>\n<p>Function inputs and outputs present in the function declaration are the &#8220;front door&#8221;. Any inputs and outputs that are not in the function declaration are &#8220;side doors&#8221;. Side doors include things like global variables, environment variables, getting information from the operating system, reading/writing files, throwing exceptions, etc. Side doors are rarely accounted for in the documentation. The poor sap calling a function has to carefully read its implementation to discern what the side doors are.</p>\n<p>Self-evident code should strive to run everything through the front door. Not only does this help with comprehension, but it also enables delightful things like easy unit testing.</p>\n<h3 id="memoryallocation">Memory Allocation</h3>\n<p>An ongoing problem faced by functions that implement an algorithm that needs to allocate memory is what memory allocation scheme should be used. Often a reusable function imposes the memory allocation method on the caller. That&#8217;s backward.</p>\n<p>For memory that is allocated and free&#8217;d by the function, the solution is that the function decides how to do it. For allocated objects that are returned by the function, the caller should decide the allocation scheme by passing an argument that specifies it. This argument often takes the form of a &#8220;sink&#8221; to send the output to. More on that later.</p>\n<h3 id="passabstract“sink”foroutput">Pass Abstract “sink” for Output</h3>\n<p>The auld way (extracted from the DMD source code):</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">import dmd.errors;\nvoid gendocfile(Module m) {\n     ...\n     if (!success)\n         error(&quot;expansion limit&quot;);\n}</pre>\n<p><code>error()</code> is a function that error messages are sent to. This is a typical formulation seen in conventional code. The error message is going out through the side door. The caller of <code>gendocfile()</code> has no say in what&#8217;s done with the error message, and the fact that it even generates error messages is usually omitted by the documentation. Worse, the error message emission makes it impractical to properly unit test the function.</p>\n<p>A better way is to pass an abstract interface &#8220;sink&#8221; as a parameter and send the error messages to the sink:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">import dmd.errorsink;\nvoid gendocfile(Module m, ErrorSink eSink) {\n     ...\n     if (!success)\n         eSink.error(&quot;expansion limit&quot;);\n}\n</pre>\n<p>Now the caller has total control of what happens to the error messages, and it is implicitly documented. A unit tester can provide a special implementation of the interface to suit testing convenience.</p>\n<p>Here’s a real-world PR making this improvement:</p>\n<p><a href="https://github.com/dlang/dmd/pull/15471">doc.d: use errorSink</a></p>\n<h3 id="passfilesasbuffersratherthanfilestoread">Pass Files as Buffers Rather than Files to Read</h3>\n<p>Typical code I&#8217;ve written, where the file names are passed to a function to read and process them:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">void gendocfile(Module m, const(char)*[] docfiles) {\n     OutBuffer mbuf;\n     foreach (file; ddocfiles) {\n         auto buffer = readFile(file.toDString());\n         mbuf.write(buffer.data);\n     }\n     ...\n}</pre>\n<p>This kind of code is a nuisance to unit test, as adding file I/O to the unit tester is very clumsy, and, as a result, no unit tests get written.

This kept the first two posts simpler in that they did not have to deal with function attribute inference, which I have referred to as &#8220;attribute auto inference&#8221; in earlier posts. However, both <code>auto</code> functions and templates are very common in D code, so a series on DIP1000 can&#8217;t be complete without explaining how those features work with the language changes. Function attribute inference is our most important tool in avoiding so-called &#8220;attribute soup&#8221;, where a function is decorated with several attributes, which arguably decreases readability.</p>\n<p>We will also dig deeper into unsafe code. The previous two posts in this series focused on the <code>scope</code> attribute, but this post is more focused on attributes and memory safety in general. Since DIP1000 is ultimately about memory safety, we can&#8217;t get around discussing those topics.</p>\n<h2 id="avoidingrepetitionwithattributes">Avoiding repetition with attributes</h2>\n<p><a href="https://dlang.org/spec/function.html#function-attribute-inference">Function attribute inference</a> means that the language will analyze the body of a function and will automatically add the <code>@safe</code>, <code>pure</code>, <code>nothrow</code>, and <code>@nogc</code> attributes where applicable. It will also attempt to add <code>scope</code> or <code>return scope</code> attributes to parameters and <code>return ref</code> to <code>ref</code> parameters that can&#8217;t otherwise be compiled. Some attributes are never inferred. For instance, the compiler will not insert any <code>ref</code>, <code>lazy</code>, <code>out</code> or <code>@trusted</code> attributes, because very likely they are explicitly not wanted where they are left out.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to turn on function attribute inference. One is by omitting the return type in the function signature. Note that the <code>auto</code> keyword is not required for this. <code>auto</code> is a placeholder keyword used when no return type, storage class, or attribute is specified. For example, the declaration <code>half(int x) { return x/2; }</code> does not parse, so we use <code>auto half(int x) { return x/2; }</code> instead. But we could just as well write <code>@safe half(int x) { return x/2; }</code> and the rest of the attributes (<code>pure</code>, <code>nothrow</code>, and <code>@nogc</code>) will be inferred just as they are with the <code>auto</code> keyword.</p>\n<p>The second way to enable attribute inference is to templatize the function. With our <code>half</code> example, it can be done this way:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">int divide(int denominator)(int x) { return x/denominator; }\nalias half = divide!2;</pre>\n<p>The D spec does not say that a template must have any parameters. An empty parameter list can be used to turn attribute inference on: <code>int half()(int x) { return x/2; }</code>. Calling this function doesn&#8217;t even require the template instantiation syntax at the call site, e.g., <code>half!()(12)</code> is not required as <code>half(12)</code> will compile.</p>\n<p>Another means to turn on attribute inference is to store the function inside another function. <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/function.html#nested">These are called nested functions</a>. Inference is enabled not only on functions nested directly inside another function but also on most things nested in a type or a template inside the function. Example:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe void parentFun()\n{\n    // This is auto-inferred.\n    int half(int x){ return x/2; }\n\n    class NestedType\n    {\n        // This is auto inferred\n        final int half1(int x) { return x/2; }\n\n        // This is not auto inferred; it\'s a\n        // virtual function and the compiler\n        // can\'t know if it has an unsafe override\n        // in a derived class.\n        int half2(int x) { return x/2; }\n    }\n\n    int a = half(12); // Works. Inferred as @safe.\n    auto cl = new NestedType;\n    int b = cl.half1(18); // Works. Inferred as @safe.\n    int c = cl.half2(26); // Error.\n}</pre>\n<p>A downside of nested functions is that they can only be used in lexical order (the call site must be below the function declaration) unless both the nested function and the call are inside the same struct, class, union, or template that is in turn inside the parent function. Another downside is that they don&#8217;t work with <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/function.html#pseudo-member">Uniform Function Call Syntax</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, attribute inference is always enabled for <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/expression.html#FunctionLiteral">function literals</a> (a.k.a. lambda functions). The halving function would be defined as <code>enum half = (int x) =&gt; x/2;</code> and called exactly as normal. However, the language does not consider this declaration a function. It considers it a function pointer. This means that in global scope it&#8217;s important to use <code>enum</code> or <code>immutable</code> instead of <code>auto</code>. Otherwise, the lambda can be changed to something else from anywhere in the program and cannot be accessed from <code>pure</code> functions. In rare cases, such mutability can be desirable, but most often it is an antipattern (like global variables in general).</p>\n<h3 id="limitsofinference">Limits of inference</h3>\n<p>Aiming for minimal manual typing isn&#8217;t always wise. Neither is aiming for maximal attribute bloat.</p>\n<p>The primary problem of auto inference is that subtle changes in the code can lead to inferred attributes turning on and off in an uncontrolled manner. To see when it matters, we need to have an idea of what will be inferred and what will not.</p>\n<p>The compiler in general will go to great lengths to infer <code>@safe</code>, <code>pure</code>, <code>nothrow</code>, and <code>@nogc</code> attributes. If your function <em>can</em> have those, it almost always will. The specification says that recursion is an exception: a function calling itself should not be <code>@safe</code>, <code>pure</code>, or <code>nothrow</code> unless explicitly specified as such. But in my testing, I found those attributes actually are inferred for recursive functions. It turns out, there is an ongoing effort to get recursive attribute inference working, and it partially works already.</p>\n<p>Inference of <code>scope</code> and <code>return</code> on function parameters is less reliable. In the most mundane cases, it&#8217;ll work, but the compiler gives up pretty quickly. The smarter the inference engine is, the more time it takes to compile, so the current design decision is to infer those attributes in only the simplest of cases.</p>\n<h3 id="wheretoletthecompilerinfer">Where to let the compiler infer?</h3>\n<p>A D programmer should get into the habit of asking, &#8220;What will happen if I mistakenly do something that makes this function unsafe, impure, throwing, garbage-collecting, or escaping?&#8221; If the answer is &#8220;immediate compiler error&#8221;, auto inference is probably fine. On the other hand, the answer could be &#8220;user code will break when updating this library I&#8217;m maintaining&#8221;. In that case, annotate manually.</p>\n<p>In addition to the potential of losing attributes the author intends to apply, there is also another risk:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe pure nothrow @nogc firstNewline(string from)\n{\n    foreach(i; 0 .. from.length) switch(from[i])\n    {\n        case \'\\r\':\n        if(from.length &gt; i+1 &amp;&amp; from[i+1] == \'\\n\')\n        {\n            return &quot;\\r\\n&quot;;\n        }\n        else return &quot;\\r&quot;;\n\n        case \'\\n\': return &quot;\\n&quot;;\n\n        default: break;\n    }\n\n    return &quot;&quot;;\n}\n</pre>\n<p>You might think that since the author is manually specifying the attributes, there&#8217;s no problem. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s wrong. Suppose the author decides to rewrite the function such that all the return values are slices of the <code>from</code> parameter rather than string literals:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe pure nothrow @nogc firstNewline(string from)\n{\n    foreach(i; 0 .. from.length) switch(from[i])\n    {\n        case \'\\r\':\n        if (from.length &gt; i + 1 &amp;&amp; from[i + 1] == \'\\n\')\n        {\n            return from[i .. i + 2];\n        }\n        else return from[i .. i + 1];\n\n        case \'\\n\': return from[i .. i + 1];\n\n        default: break;\n    }\n\n    return &quot;&quot;;\n}</pre>\n<p>Surprise! The parameter <code>from</code> was previously inferred as <code>scope</code>, and a library user was relying on that, but now it&#8217;s inferred as <code>return scope</code> instead, breaking client code.</p>\n<p>Still, for internal functions, auto inference is a great way to save both our fingers when writing and our eyes when reading. Note that it&#8217;s perfectly fine to rely on auto inference of the <code>@safe</code> attribute as long as the function is used in explicitly in <code>@safe</code> functions or unit tests. If something potentially unsafe is done inside the auto-inferred function, it gets inferred as <code>@system</code>, not <code>@trusted</code>. Calling a <code>@system</code> function from a <code>@safe</code> function results in a compiler error, meaning auto inference is safe to rely on in this case.</p>\n<p>It still sometimes makes sense to manually apply attributes to internal functions, because the error messages generated when they are violated tend to be better with manual attributes.</p>\n<h3 id="whatabouttemplates">What about templates?</h3>\n<p>Auto inference is always enabled for templated functions. What if a library interface needs to expose one? There is a way to block the inference, albeit an ugly one:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">private template FunContainer(T)\n{\n    // Not auto inferred\n    // (only eponymous template functions are)\n    @safe T fun(T arg){return arg + 3;}\n}\n\n// Auto inferred per se, but since the function it calls\n// is not, only @safe is inferred.\nauto addThree(T)(T arg){return FunContainer!T.fun(arg);}</pre>\n<p>However, which attributes a template should have often depends on its compile-time parameters. It would be possible to use metaprogramming to designate attributes depending on the template parameters, but that would be a lot of work, hard to read, and easily as error-prone as relying on auto inference.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s more practical to just test that the function template infers the wanted attributes. Such testing doesn&#8217;t have to, and probably shouldn&#8217;t, be done manually each time the function is changed. Instead:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">float multiplyResults(alias fun)(float[] arr)\n    if (is(typeof(fun(new float)) : float))\n{\n    float result = 1.0f;\n    foreach (ref e; arr) result *= fun(&amp;e);\n    return result;\n}\n\n@safe pure nothrow unittest\n{\n    float fun(float* x){return *x+1;}\n    // Using a static array makes sure\n    // arr argument is inferred as scope or\n    // return scope\n    float[5] elements = [1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f, 4.0f, 5.0f];\n\n    // No need to actually do anything with\n    // the result. The idea is that since this\n    // compiles, multiplyResults is proven @safe\n    // pure nothrow, and its argument is scope or\n    // return scope.\n    multiplyResults!fun(elements);\n}</pre>\n<p>Thanks to D&#8217;s compile-time introspection powers, testing against unwanted attributes is also covered:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe unittest\n{\n    import std.traits : attr = FunctionAttribute,\n        functionAttributes, isSafe;\n\n    float fun(float* x)\n    {\n        // Makes the function both throwing\n        // and garbage collector dependant.\n        if (*x &gt; 5) throw new Exception(&quot;&quot;);\n        static float* impureVar;\n\n        // Makes the function impure.\n        auto result = impureVar? *impureVar: 5;\n\n        // Makes the argument unscoped.\n        impureVar = x;\n        return result;\n    }\n\n    enum attrs = functionAttributes!(multiplyResults!fun);\n\n    assert(!(attrs &amp; attr.nothrow_));\n    assert(!(attrs &amp; attr.nogc));\n\n    // Checks against accepting scope arguments.\n    // Note that this check does not work with\n    // @system functions.\n    assert(!isSafe!(\n    {\n        float[5] stackFloats;\n        multiplyResults!fun(stackFloats[]);\n    }));\n\n    // It\'s a good idea to do positive tests with\n    // similar methods to make sure the tests above\n    // would fail if the tested function had the\n    // wrong attributes.\n    assert(attrs &amp; attr.safe);\n    assert(isSafe!(\n    {\n        float[] heapFloats;\n        multiplyResults!fun(heapFloats[]);\n    }));\n}</pre>\n<p>If assertion failures are wanted at compile time before the unit tests are run, adding the <code>static</code> keyword before each of those <code>assert</code>s will get the job done. Those compiler errors can even be had in non-unittest builds by converting that unit test to a regular function, e.g., by replacing <code>@safe unittest</code> with, say, <code>private @safe testAttrs()</code>.</p>\n<h2 id="thelivefireexercise:system">The live fire exercise: @system</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s not forget that D is a systems programming language. As this series has shown, in most D code the programmer is well protected from memory errors, but D would not be D if it didn&#8217;t allow going low-level and bypassing the type system in the same manner as C or C++: bit arithmetic on pointers, writing and reading directly to hardware ports, executing a <code>struct</code> destructor on a raw byte blob&#8230; D is designed to do all of that.</p>\n<p>The difference is that in C and C++ it takes only one mistake to break the type system and <a href="https://blog.regehr.org/archives/213">cause undefined behavior</a> anywhere in the code. A D programmer is only at risk when not in a <code>@safe</code> function, or when using dangerous compiler switches such as <code>-release</code> or <code>-check=assert=off</code> (failing a disabled assertion is undefined behavior), and even then the semantics tend to be less UB-prone. For example:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">float cube(float arg)\n{\n    float result;\n    result *= arg;\n    result *= arg;\n    return result;\n}</pre>\n<p>This is a language-agnostic function that compiles in C, C++, and D. Someone intended to calculate the cube of <code>arg</code> but forgot to initialize <code>result</code> with <code>arg</code>. In D, nothing dangerous happens despite this being a <code>@system</code> function. No initialization value means <code>result</code> is default initialized to <code>NaN</code> (not-a-number), which leads to the result also being <code>NaN</code>, which is a glaringly obvious &#8220;error&#8221; value when using this function the first time.</p>\n<p>However, in C and C++, not initializing a local variable means reading it is (sans a few narrow exceptions) <em>undefined behavior</em>. This function does not even handle pointers, yet according to the standard, calling this function could just as well have <code>*(int*) rand() = 0XDEADBEEF;</code> in it, all due to a trivial mistake. While many compilers with enabled warnings will catch this one, not all do, and these languages are full of similar examples where even warnings don&#8217;t help.</p>\n<p>In D, even if you explicitly requested no default initialization with <code>float result = void</code>, it&#8217;d just mean the return value of the function is undefined, not anything and everything that happens if the function is called. Consequently, that function could be annotated <code>@safe</code> even with such an initializer.</p>\n<p>Still, for anyone who cares about memory safety, as they probably should for anything intended for a wide audience, it&#8217;s a bad idea to assume that D <code>@system</code> code is safe enough to be the default mode. Two examples will demonstrate what can happen.</p>\n<h3 id="whatundefinedbehaviorcando">What undefined behavior can do</h3>\n<p>Some people assume that &#8220;Undefined Behavior&#8221; simply means &#8220;erroneous behavior&#8221; or crashing at runtime. While that is often what ultimately happens, undefined behavior is far more dangerous than, say, an uncaught exception or an infinite loop. The difference is that with undefined behavior, you have no guarantees at all about what happens. This might not sound any worse than an infinite loop, but an accidental infinite loop is discovered the first time it&#8217;s entered. Code with undefined behavior, on the other hand, might do what was intended when it&#8217;s tested, but then do something completely different in production. Even if the code is tested with the same flags it&#8217;s compiled with in production, the behavior may change from one compiler version to another, or when making completely unrelated changes to the code. Time for an example:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">// return whether the exception itself is in the array\nbool replaceExceptions(Object[] arr, ref Exception e)\n{\n    bool result;\n    foreach (ref o; arr)\n    {\n        if (&amp;o is &amp;e) result = true;\n        if (cast(Exception) o) o = e;\n    }\n\n    return result;\n}</pre>\n<p>The idea here is that the function replaces all exceptions in the array with <code>e</code>. If <code>e</code> itself is in the array, it returns <code>true</code>, otherwise <code>false</code>. And indeed, testing confirms it works. The function is used like this:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">auto arr = [new Exception(&quot;a&quot;), null, null, new Exception(&quot;c&quot;)];\nauto result = replaceExceptions\n(\n    cast(Object[]) arr,\n    arr[3]\n);</pre>\n<p>This cast is not a problem, right? Object references are always of the same size regardless of their type, and we&#8217;re casting the exceptions to the parent type, <code>Object</code>. It&#8217;s not like the array contains anything other than object references.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, that&#8217;s not how <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/expression.html#AssignExpression">the D specification views it</a>. Having two class references (or any references, for that matter) in the same memory location but with different types, and then assigning one of them to the other, is undefined behavior. That&#8217;s exactly what happens in</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">if (cast(Exception) o) o = e;</pre>\n<p>if the array does contain the <code>e</code> argument. Since <code>true</code> can only be returned when undefined behavior is triggered, it means that any compiler would be free to optimize <code>replaceExceptions</code> to always return <code>false</code>. This is a dormant bug no amount of testing will find, but that might, years later, completely mess up the application when compiled with the powerful optimizations of an advanced compiler.</p>\n<p>It may seem that requiring a cast to use a function is an obvious warning sign that a good D programmer would not ignore. I wouldn&#8217;t be so sure. Casts aren&#8217;t that rare even in fine high-level code. Even if you disagree, other cases are provably bad enough to bite anyone. Last summer, this case <a href="https://forum.dlang.org/thread/t7qd45$1lrb$1@digitalmars.com">appeared in the D forums</a>:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">string foo(in string s)\n{\n    return s;\n}\n\nvoid main()\n{\n    import std.stdio;\n    string[] result;\n    foreach(c; &quot;hello&quot;)\n    {\n        result ~= foo([c]);\n    }\n    writeln(result);\n}</pre>\n<p>This problem was encountered by Steven Schveighoffer, a long-time D veteran who has himself <a href="https://dlang.org/blog/2016/09/28/how-to-write-trusted-code-in-d/">lectured about <code>@safe</code> and <code>@system</code></a> on <a href="https://dconf.org/2020/online/#steven">more than one occasion</a>. Anything that can burn him can burn any of us.</p>\n<p>Normally, this works just as one would think and is fine according to the spec. However, if one enables <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/function.html#in-params">another soon-to-be-default language feature</a> with the <code>-preview=in</code> compiler switch along with DIP1000, the program starts malfunctioning. The old semantics for <code>in</code> are the same as <code>const</code>, but the new semantics make it <code>const scope</code>.</p>\n<p>Since the argument of <code>foo</code> is <code>scope</code>, the compiler assumes that <code>foo</code> will copy <code>[c]</code> before returning it, or return something else, and therefore it allocates <code>[c]</code> on the same stack position for each of the &#8220;hello&#8221; letters. The result is that the program prints <code>[&quot;o&quot;, &quot;o, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;o&quot;]</code>. At least for me, it&#8217;s already somewhat hard to understand what&#8217;s happening in this simple example. Hunting down this sort of bug in a complex codebase could be a nightmare.</p>\n<p>(With my nightly DMD version somewhere between 2.100 and 2.101 a compile-time error is printed instead. With 2.100.2, the example runs as described above.)</p>\n<p>The fundamental problem in both of these examples is the same: <code>@safe</code> is not used. Had it been, both of these undefined behaviors would have resulted in compilation errors (the <code>replaceExceptions</code> function itself can be <code>@safe</code>, but the cast at the usage site cannot). By now it should be clear that <code>@system</code> code should be used sparingly.</p>\n<h3 id="whentoproceedanyway">When to proceed anyway</h3>\n<p>Sooner or later, though, the time comes when the guard rail has to be temporarily lowered. Here&#8217;s an example of a good use case:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">/// Undefined behavior: Passing a non-null pointer\n/// to a standalone character other than \'\\0\', or\n/// to an array without \'\\0\' at or after the\n/// pointed character, as utf8Stringz\nextern(C) @system pure\nbool phobosValidateUTF8(const char* utf8Stringz)\n{\n    import std.string, std.utf;\n\n    try utf8Stringz.fromStringz.validate();\n    catch (UTFException) return false;\n\n    return true;\n}</pre>\n<p>This function lets code written in another language validate a UTF-8 string using Phobos. C being C, it tends to use zero-terminated strings, so the function accepts a pointer to one as the argument instead of a D array. This is why the function has to be unsafe. There is no way to safely check that <code>utf8Stringz</code> is pointing to either <code>null</code> or a valid C string. If the character being pointed to is not <code>\'\\0\'</code>, meaning the next character has to be read, the function has no way of knowing whether that character belongs to the memory allocated for the string. It can only trust that the calling code got it right.</p>\n<p>Still, this function is a good use of the <code>@system</code> attribute. First, it is presumably called primarily from C or C++. Those languages do not get any safety guarantees anyway. Even a <code>@safe</code> function is safe only if it gets only those parameters that can be created in <code>@safe</code> D code. Passing <code>cast(const char*) 0xFE0DA1</code> as an argument to a function is unsafe no matter what the attribute says, and nothing in C or C++ verifies what arguments are passed.</p>\n<p>Second, the function clearly documents the cases that would trigger undefined behavior. However, it does not mention that passing an invalid pointer, such as the aforementioned <code>cast(const char*) 0xFE0DA1</code>, is UB, because UB is always the default assumption with <code>@system</code>-only values unless it can be shown otherwise.</p>\n<p>Third, the function is small and easy to review manually. No function should be needlessly big, but it&#8217;s many times more important than usual to keep <code>@system</code> and <code>@trusted</code> functions small and simple to review. <code>@safe</code> functions can be debugged to pretty good shape by testing, but as we saw earlier, undefined behavior can be immune to testing. Analyzing the code is the only general answer to UB.</p>\n<p>There is a reason why the parameter does not have a <code>scope</code> attribute. It could have it, no pointers to the string are escaped. However, it would not provide many benefits. Any code calling the function has to be <code>@system</code>, <code>@trusted</code>, or in a foreign language, meaning they can pass a pointer to the stack in any case. <code>scope</code> could potentially improve the performance of D client code in exchange for the increased potential for undefined behavior if this function is erroneously refactored. Such a tradeoff is unwanted in general unless it can be shown that the attribute helps with a performance problem. On the other hand, the attribute would make it clearer for the reader that the string is not supposed to escape. It&#8217;s a difficult judgment call whether <code>scope</code> would be a wise addition here.</p>\n<h3 id="furtherimprovements">Further improvements</h3>\n<p>It should be documented why a <code>@system</code> function is <code>@system</code> when it&#8217;s not obvious. Often there is a safer alternative&mdash;our example function could have taken a D array or the CString struct from the previous post in this series. Why was an alternative not taken? In our case, we could write that the ABI would be different for either of those options, complicating matters on the C side, and the intended client (C code) is unsafe anyway.</p>\n<p><code>@trusted</code> functions are like <code>@system</code> functions, except they can be called from <code>@safe</code> functions, whereas <code>@system</code> functions cannot. When something is declared <code>@trusted</code>, it means the authors have verified that it&#8217;s just as safe to use as an actual <code>@safe</code> function with any arguments that can be created within safe code. They need to be just as carefully reviewed, if not more so, as <code>@system</code> functions.</p>\n<p>In these situations, it should be documented (for other developers, not users) how the function was deemed to be safe in all situations. Or, if the function is not fully safe to use and the attribute is just a temporary hack, it should have a big ugly warning about that.</p>\n<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3131" height="383" src="https://dlang.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/unsafe-safe.jpg" width="651" /></p>\n<p>Such greenwashing is of course highly discouraged, but if there&#8217;s a codebase full of <code>@system</code> code that&#8217;s just too difficult to make <code>@safe</code> otherwise, it&#8217;s better than giving up. Even as we often talk about the dangers of UB and memory corruption, in our actual work our attitudes tend to be much more carefree, meaning such codebases are unfortunately common.</p>\n<p>It might be tempting to define a small <code>@trusted</code> function inside a bigger <code>@safe</code> function to do something unsafe without disabling checks for the whole function:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">extern(C) @safe pure\nbool phobosValidateUTF8(const char* utf8Stringz)\n{\n    import std.string, std.utf;\n\n    try (() @trusted =&gt; utf8Stringz.fromStringz)()\n      .validate();\n    catch (UTFException) return false;\n\n    return true;\n}</pre>\n<p>Keep in mind though, that the parent function needs to be documented and reviewed like an overt <code>@trusted</code> function because the encapsulated <code>@trusted</code> function can let the parent function do anything. In addition, since the function is marked <code>@safe</code>, it isn&#8217;t obvious on a first look that it&#8217;s a function that needs special care. Thus, a visible warning comment is needed if you elect to use <code>@trusted</code> like this.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, don&#8217;t trust yourself! Just like any codebase of non-trivial size has bugs, more than a handful of <code>@system</code> functions will include latent UB at some point. The remaining hardening features of D, meaning asserts, contracts, invariants, and bounds checking should be used aggressively and kept enabled in production. This is recommended even if the program is fully <code>@safe</code>. In addition, a project with a considerable amount of unsafe code should use external tools like LLVM address sanitizer and Valgrind to at least some extent.</p>\n<p>Note that the idea in many of these hardening tools, both those in the language and those of the external tools, is to crash as soon as any fault is detected. It decreases the chance of any surprise from undefined behavior doing more serious damage.</p>\n<p>This requires that the program is designed to accept a crash at any moment. The program must never hold such amounts of unsaved data that there would be any hesitation in crashing it. If it controls anything important, it must be able to regain control after being restarted by a user or another process, or it must have another backup program. Any program that &#8220;can&#8217;t afford&#8221; to run potentially crashing checks is in no business to be trusted with systems programming either.</p>\n<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>That concludes this blog series on DIP1000. There are some topics related to DIP1000 we have left up to the readers to experiment with themselves, such as associative arrays.

But D can refer to the stack in other ways, too, and that&#8217;s the topic of this article.</p>\n<h2 id="object-orientedinstancesaretheeasiestcase">Object-oriented instances are the easiest case</h2>\n<p>In Part 1, I said that if you understand how DIP1000 works with pointers, then you understand how it works with classes. An example is worth more than mere words:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe Object ifNull(return scope Object a, return scope Object b)\n{\n    return a? a: b;\n}</pre>\n<p>The <code>return scope</code> in the above example works exactly as it does in the following:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe int* ifNull(return scope int* a, return scope int* b)\n{\n    return a? a: b;\n}</pre>\n<p>The principle is: if the <code>scope</code> or <code>return scope</code> storage class is applied to an object in a parameter list, the address of the object instance is protected just as if the parameter were a pointer to the instance. From the perspective of machine code, it <strong>is</strong> a pointer to the instance.</p>\n<p>From the point of view of regular functions, that&#8217;s all there is to it. What about member functions of a class or an interface? This is how it&#8217;s done:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">interface Talkative\n{\n    @safe const(char)[] saySomething() scope;\n}\n\nclass Duck : Talkative\n{\n    char[8] favoriteWord;\n    @safe const(char)[] saySomething() scope\n    {\n        import std.random : dice;\n\n        // This wouldn\'t work\n        // return favoriteWord[];\n\n        // This does\n        return favoriteWord[].dup;\n\n        // Also returning something totally\n        // different works. This\n        // returns the first entry 40% of the time,\n        // The second entry 40% of the time, and\n        // the third entry the rest of the time.\n        return\n        [\n            &quot;quack!&quot;,\n            &quot;Quack!!&quot;,\n            &quot;QUAAACK!!!&quot;\n        ][dice(2,2,1)];\n    }\n}</pre>\n<p><code>scope</code> positioned either before or after the member function name marks the <code>this</code> reference as <code>scope</code>, preventing it from leaking out of the function. Because the address of the instance is protected, nothing that refers directly to the address of the fields is allowed to escape either. That&#8217;s why <code>return favoriteWord[]</code> is disallowed; it&#8217;s a static array stored inside the class instance, so the returned slice would refer directly to it. <code>favoriteWord[].dup</code> on the other hand returns a copy of the data that isn&#8217;t located in the class instance, which is why it&#8217;s okay.</p>\n<p>Alternatively one could replace the <code>scope</code> attributes of both <code>Talkative.saySomething</code> and <code>Duck.saySomething</code> with <code>return scope</code>, allowing the return of <code>favoriteWord</code> without duplication.</p>\n<h3 id="dip1000andliskovsubstitutionprinciple">DIP1000 and Liskov Substitution Principle</h3>\n<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle">The Liskov substitution principle</a> states, in simplified terms, that an inherited function can give the caller more guarantees than its parent function, but never fewer. DIP1000-related attributes fall in that category. The rule works like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> if a parameter (including the implicit <code>this</code> reference) in the parent functions has no DIP1000 attributes, the child function may designate it <code>scope</code> or <code>return scope</code></li>\n<li> if a parameter is designated <code>scope</code> in the parent, it must be designated <code>scope</code> in the child</li>\n<li> if a parameter is <code>return scope</code> in the parent, it must be either <code>scope</code> or <code>return scope</code> in the child</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If there is no attribute, the caller can not assume anything; the function might store the address of the argument somewhere. If <code>return scope</code> is present, the caller can assume the address of the argument is not stored other than in the return value. With <code>scope</code>, the guarantee is that the address is not stored anywhere, which is an even stronger guarantee. Example:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">class C1\n{   double*[] incomeLog;\n    @safe double* imposeTax(double* pIncome)\n    {\n        incomeLog ~= pIncome;\n        return new double(*pIncome * .15);\n    }\n}\n\nclass C2 : C1\n{\n    // Okay from language perspective (but maybe not fair\n    // for the taxpayer)\n    override @safe double* imposeTax\n        (return scope double* pIncome)\n    {\n        return pIncome;\n    }\n}\n\nclass C3 : C2\n{\n    // Also okay.\n    override @safe double* imposeTax\n        (scope double* pIncome)\n    {\n        return new double(*pIncome * .18);\n    }\n}\n\nclass C4: C3\n{\n    // Not okay. The pIncome parameter of C3.imposeTax\n    // is scope, and this tries to relax the restriction.\n    override @safe double* imposeTax\n        (double* pIncome)\n    {\n        incomeLog ~= pIncome;\n        return new double(*pIncome * .16);\n    }\n}</pre>\n<h2 id="thespecialpointerref">The special pointer, <code>ref</code></h2>\n<p>We still have not uncovered how to use <code>struct</code>s and <code>union</code>s with DIP1000. Well, obviously we&#8217;ve uncovered pointers and arrays. When referring to a <code>struct</code> or a <code>union</code>, they work the same as they do when referring to any other type. But pointers and arrays are not the canonical way to use structs in D. They are most often passed around by value, or by reference when <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/function.html#ref-params">bound to <code>ref</code> parameters</a>. Now is a good time to explain how <code>ref</code> works with DIP1000.</p>\n<p>They don&#8217;t work like just any pointer. Once you understand <code>ref</code>, you can use DIP1000 in many ways you otherwise could not.</p>\n<h3 id="asimplerefintparameter">A simple <code>ref int</code> parameter</h3>\n<p>The simplest possible way to use <code>ref</code> is probably this:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe void fun(ref int arg) {\n    arg = 5;\n}</pre>\n<p>What does this mean? <code>ref</code> is internally a pointer&mdash;think <code>int* pArg</code>&mdash;but is used like a value in the source code. <code>arg = 5</code> works internally like <code>*pArg = 5</code>. Also, the client calls the function as if the argument were passed by value:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">auto anArray = [1,2];\nfun(anArray[1]); // or, via UFCS: anArray[1].fun;\n// anArray is now [1, 5]</pre>\n<p>instead of <code>fun(&amp;anArray[1])</code>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_(C%2B%2B)">Unlike C++ references</a>, D <code>ref</code>erences can be <code>null</code>, but the application will instantly terminate with a segmentation fault if a null <code>ref</code> is used for something other than reading the address with the <code>&amp;</code> operator. So this:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">int* ptr = null;\nfun(*ptr);</pre>\n<p>&#8230;compiles, but crashes at runtime because the assignment inside <code>fun</code> lands at the null address.</p>\n<p>The address of a <code>ref</code> variable is always guarded against escape. In this sense <code>@safe void fun(ref int arg){arg = 5;}</code> is like <code>@safe void fun(scope int* pArg){*pArg = 5;}</code>. For example, <code>@safe int* fun(ref int arg){return &amp;arg;}</code> will not compile, just like <code>@safe int* fun(scope int* pArg){return pArg;}</code> will not.</p>\n<p>There is a <code>return ref</code> storage class, however, that allows returning the address of the parameter but no other form of escape, just like <code>return scope</code>. This means that <code>@safe int* fun(return ref int arg){return &amp;arg;}</code> works.</p>\n<h3 id="referencetoareference"><code>ref</code>erence to a reference</h3>\n<p><code>ref</code>erence to an <code>int</code> or similar type already allows much nicer syntax than one can get with pointers. But the real power of <code>ref</code> shows when it refers to a type that is a reference itself&mdash;a pointer or a class, for instance. <code>scope</code> or <code>return scope</code> can be applied to a reference that is referenced to by <code>ref</code>. For example:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe float[] mergeSort(ref return scope float[] arr)\n{\n    import std.algorithm: merge;\n    import std.array : Appender;\n\n    if(arr.length &lt; 2) return arr;\n\n    auto firstHalf = arr[0 .. $/2];\n    auto secondHalf = arr[$/2 .. $];\n\n    Appender!(float[]) output;\n    output.reserve(arr.length);\n\n    foreach\n    (\n        el;\n        firstHalf.mergeSort\n        .merge!floatLess(secondHalf.mergeSort)\n    )   output ~= el;\n\n    arr = output[];\n    return arr;\n}\n\n@safe bool floatLess(float a, float b)\n{\n    import std.math: isNaN;\n\n    return a.isNaN? false:\n          b.isNaN? true:\n          a&lt;b;\n}</pre>\n<p><code>mergeSort</code> here guarantees it won&#8217;t leak the address of the <code>float</code>s in <code>arr</code> except in the return value. This is the same guarantee that would be had from a <code>return scope float[] arr</code> parameter. But at the same time, because <code>arr</code> is a <code>ref</code> parameter, <code>mergeSort</code> can mutate the array passed to it. Then the client can write:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">float[] values = [5, 1.5, 0, 19, 1.5, 1];\nvalues.mergeSort;</pre>\n<p>With a non-<code>ref</code> argument, the client would have to write <code>values = values.sort</code> instead (not using <code>ref</code> would be a perfectly reasonable API in this case, because we do not always want to mutate the original array). This is something that cannot be accomplished with pointers, because <code>return scope float[]* arr</code> would protect the address of the array&#8217;s metadata (the <code>length</code> and <code>ptr</code> fields of the array), not the address of it&#8217;s contents.</p>\n<p>It is also possible to have a returnable <code>ref</code> argument to a <code>scope</code> reference. Since this example has a unit test, remember to use the <code>-unittest</code> compile flag to include it in the compiled binary.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe ref Exception nullify(return ref scope Exception obj)\n{\n    obj = null;\n    return obj;\n}\n\n@safe unittest\n{\n    scope obj = new Exception(&quot;Error!&quot;);\n    assert(obj.msg == &quot;Error!&quot;);\n    obj.nullify;\n    assert(obj is null);\n    // Since nullify returns by ref, we can assign\n    // to it\'s return value.\n    obj.nullify = new Exception(&quot;Fail!&quot;);\n    assert(obj.msg == &quot;Fail!&quot;);\n}</pre>\n<p>Here we return the address of the argument passed to <code>nullify</code>, but still guard both the address of the object pointer and the address of the class instance against being leaked by other channels.</p>\n<p><code>return</code> is a free keyword that does not mandate <code>ref</code> or <code>scope</code> to follow it. What does <code>void* fun(ref scope return int*)</code> mean then? <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/function.html#ref-return-scope-parameters">The spec states</a> that <code>return</code> without a trailing <code>scope</code> is always treated as <code>ref return</code>. This example thus is equivalent to <code>void* fun(return ref scope int*)</code>. However, this only applies if there is <code>ref</code>erence to bind to. Writing <code>void* fun(scope return int*)</code> means <code>void* fun(return scope int*)</code>. It&#8217;s even possible to write <code>void* fun(return int*)</code> with the latter meaning, but I leave it up to you to decide whether this qualifies as conciseness or obfuscation.</p>\n<h2 id="memberfunctionsandref">Member functions and <code>ref</code></h2>\n<p><code>ref</code> and <code>return ref</code> often require careful consideration to keep track of which address is protected and what can be returned. It takes some experience to get confortable with them. But once you do, understanding how <code>struct</code>s and <code>union</code>s work with DIP1000 is pretty straightforward.</p>\n<p>The major difference to classes is that where the <code>this</code> reference is just a regular class reference in class member functions, <code>this</code> in a struct or union member function is <code>ref StructOrUnionName</code>.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">union Uni\n{\n    int asInt;\n    char[4] asCharArr;\n\n    // Return value contains a reference to\n    // this union, won\'t escape references\n    // to it via any other channel\n    @safe char[] latterHalf() return\n    {\n        return asCharArr[2 .. $];\n    }\n\n    // This argument is implicitly ref, so the\n    // following means the return value does\n    // not refer to this union, and also that\n    // we don\'t leak it in any other way.\n    @safe char[] latterHalfCopy()\n    {\n        return latterHalf.dup;\n    }\n}</pre>\n<p>Note that <code>return ref</code> should not be used with the <code>this</code> argument. <code>char[] latterHalf() return ref</code> fails to parse. The language already has to understand what <code>ref char[] latterHalf() return</code> means: the return value is a <code>ref</code>erence. The &#8220;ref&#8221; in <code>return ref</code> would be redundant anyway.</p>\n<p>Note that we did not use the <code>scope</code> keyword here. <code>scope</code> would be meaningless with this union, because it does not contain references to anything. Just like it is meaningless to have a <code>scope ref int</code>, or a <code>scope int</code> function argument. <code>scope</code> makes sense only for types that refer to memory elsewhere.</p>\n<p><code>scope</code> in a <code>struct</code> or <code>union</code> means the same thing as it means in a static array. It means that the memory its members refer to cannot be escaped. Example:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">struct CString\n{\n    // We need to put the pointer in an anonymous\n    // union with a dummy member, otherwise @safe user\n    // code could assign ptr to point to a character\n    // not in a C string.\n    union\n    {\n        // Empty string literals get optimised to null pointers by D\n        // compiler, we have to do this for the .init value to really point to\n        // a \'\\0\'.\n        immutable(char)* ptr = &amp;nullChar;\n        size_t dummy;\n    }\n\n    // In constructors, the &quot;return value&quot; is the\n    // constructed data object.

This example demonstrates why. Imagine how easy it&#8217;d be to use a regular assert or forget about them totally, or overlook the need to use the anonymous union. I <em>think</em> this struct is safe to use, but it&#8217;s entirely possible I overlooked something.</p>\n<h2 id="finally">Finally</h2>\n<p>We almost know all there is to know about using structs, unions, and classes with DIP1000. We have two final things to learn today.</p>\n<p>But before that, a short digression regarding the <code>scope</code> keyword. It is not used for just annotating parameters and local variables as illustrated. It is also used for <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/class.html#auto">scope classes</a> and <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/statement.html#scope-guard-statement">scope guard statements</a>. This guide won&#8217;t be discussing those, because the former feature is deprecated, and the latter is not related to DIP1000 or control of variable lifetimes. The point of mentioning them is to dispel a potential misconception that <code>scope</code> always means limiting the lifetime of something. Learning about scope guard statements is still a good idea, as it&#8217;s a useful feature.</p>\n<p>Back to the topic. The first thing is not really specific to structs or classes. We discussed what <code>return</code>, <code>return ref</code>, and <code>return scope</code> usually mean, but there&#8217;s an alternative meaning to them. Consider:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe void getFirstSpace\n(\n    ref scope string result,\n    return scope string where\n)\n{\n    //...\n}</pre>\n<p>The usual meaning of the <code>return</code> attribute makes no sense here, as the function has a <code>void</code> return type. A special rule applies in this case: if the return type is <code>void</code>, and the first argument is <code>ref</code> or <code>out</code>, any subsequent <code>return</code> [<code>ref</code>/<code>scope</code>] is assumed to be escaped by assigning to the first argument. With struct member functions, they are assumed to be assigned to the struct itself.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe unittest\n{\n    static string output;\n    immutable(char)[8] input = &quot;on stack&quot;;\n    //Trying to assign stack contents to a static\n    //variable. Won\'t compile.\n    getFirstSpace(output, input);\n}</pre>\n<p>Since <code>out</code> came up, it should be said it would be a better choice for <code>result</code> here than <code>ref</code>. <code>out</code> works like <code>ref</code>, with the one difference that the referenced data is automatically default-initialized at the beginning of the function, meaning any data to which the <code>out</code> parameter refers is guaranteed to not affect the function.</p>\n<p>The second thing to learn is that <code>scope</code> is used by the compiler to optimize class allocations inside function bodies. If a <code>new</code> class is used to initialize a <code>scope</code> variable, the compiler can put it on the stack. Example:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">class C{int a, b, c;}\n@safe @nogc unittest\n{\n    // Since this unittest is @nogc, this wouldn\'t\n    // compile without the scope optimization.\n    scope C c = new C();\n}</pre>\n<p>This feature requires using the <code>scope</code> keyword explicitly. Inference of <code>scope</code> does not work, because initializing a class this way does not normally (meaning, without the <code>@nogc</code> attribute) mandate limiting the lifetime of <code>c</code>. The feature currently works only with classes, but there is no reason it couldn&#8217;t work with <code>new</code>ed struct pointers and array literals too.</p>\n<h3 id="untilnexttime">Until next time</h3>\n<p>This is pretty much all that there is to manual DIP1000 usage. But this blog series shall not be over yet! DIP1000 is not intended to always be used explicitly&mdash;it works with attribute inference. That&#8217;s what the next post will cover.</p>\n<p>It will also cover some considerations when daring to use <code>@trusted</code> and <code>@system</code> code. The need for dangerous systems programming exists and is part of the D language domain. But even systems programming is a responsible affair when people do what they can to minimize risks. We will see that even there it&#8217;s possible to do a lot.</p>\n<p><em>Thanks to Walter Bright and Dennis Korpel for reviewing this article</em></p>'}]}

Modern high-level languages like D are memory safe, preventing users from accidently reading or writing to unused memory or breaking the type system of the language.</p>\n<p>As a systems programming language, not all of D can give such guarantees, but it does have a memory-safe subset that uses the garbage collector to take care of memory management much like Java, C#, or Go. A D codebase, even in a systems programming project, should aim to remain within that memory-safe subset where practical. D provides the <code>@safe</code> function attribute to verify that a function uses only memory-safe features of the language. For instance, try this.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe string getBeginning(immutable(char)* cString)\n{\n    return cString[0..3];\n}</pre>\n<p>The compiler will refuse to compile this code. There&#8217;s no way to know what will result from the three-character slice of <code>cString</code>, which could be referring to an empty string (i.e., <code>cString[0]</code> is <code>\\0</code>), a string with a length of <code>1</code>, or even one or two characters without the terminating NUL. The result in those cases would be a memory violation.</p>\n<h3 id="safedoesnotmeanslow"><code>@safe</code> does not mean slow</h3>\n<p>Note that I said above that even a low-level systems programming project should use <code>@safe</code> where practical. How is that possible, given that such projects sometimes cannot use the garbage collector, a major tool used in D to guarantee memory safety?</p>\n<p>Indeed, such projects must resort to memory-unsafe constructs every now and then. Even higher-level projects often have reasons to do so, as they want to create interfaces to C or C++ libraries, or avoid the garbage collector when indicated by runtime performance. But still, surprisingly large parts of code can be made <code>@safe</code> without using the garbage collector at all.</p>\n<p>D can do this because the memory safe subset does not prevent raw memory access per se.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe void add(int* a, int* b, int* sum)\n{\n    *sum = *a + *b;\n}</pre>\n<p>This compiles and is fully memory safe, despite dereferencing those pointers in the same completely unchecked way they are dereferenced in C. This is memory safe because <code>@safe</code> D does not allow creating an <code>int*</code> that points to unallocated memory areas, or to a <code>float**</code>, for instance. <code>int*</code> can point to the null address, but this is generally not a memory safety problem because the null address is protected by the operating system. Any attempt to dereference it would crash the program before any memory corruption can happen. The garbage collector isn&#8217;t involved, because D&#8217;s GC can only run if more memory is requestend from it, or if the collection is explicitly called.</p>\n<p>D slices are similar. When indexed at runtime, they will check at runtime that the index is less than their length and that&#8217;s it. They will do no checking whatsoever on whether they are referring to a legal memory area. Memory safety is achieved by preventing creation of slices that could refer to illegal memory in the first place, as demonstrated in the first example of this article. And again, there&#8217;s no GC involved.</p>\n<p>This enables many patterns that are memory-safe, efficient, and independent of the garbage collector.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">struct Struct\n{\n    int[] slice;\n    int* pointer;\n    int[10] staticArray;\n}\n\n@safe @nogc Struct examples(Struct arg)\n{\n    arg.slice[5] = *arg.pointer;\n    arg.staticArray[0..5] = arg.slice[5..10];\n    arg.pointer = &amp;arg.slice[8];\n    return arg;\n}</pre>\n<p>As demonstrated, D liberally lets one do unchecked memory handling in <code>@safe</code> code. The memory referred to by <code>arg.slice</code> and <code>arg.pointer</code> may be on the garbage collected heap, or it may be in the static program memory. There is no reason the language needs to care. The program will probably need to either call the garbage collector or do some unsafe memory management to allocate memory for the pointer and the slice, but handling already allocated memory does not need to do either. If this function needed the garbage collector, it would fail to compile because of the <code>@nogc</code> attribute.</p>\n<h3 id="however...">However&#8230;</h3>\n<p>There&#8217;s a historical design flaw here in that the memory may also be on the stack. Consider what happens if we change our function a bit.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe @nogc Struct examples(Struct arg)\n{\n    arg.pointer = &amp;arg.staticArray[8];\n    arg.slice = arg.staticArray[0..8];\n    return arg;\n}</pre>\n<p><code>Struct arg</code> is a value type. Its contents are copied to the stack when <code>examples</code> is called and can be ovewritten after the function returns. <code>staticArray</code> is also a value type. It&#8217;s copied along with the rest of the struct just as if there were ten integers in the struct instead. When we return <code>arg</code>, the contents of <code>staticArray</code> are copied to the return value, but <code>ptr</code> and <code>slice</code> continue to point to <code>arg</code>, not the returned copy!</p>\n<p>But we have a fix. It allows one to write code just as performant in <code>@safe</code> functions as before, including references to the stack. It even enables a few formerly <code>@system</code> (the opposite of <code>@safe</code>) tricks to be written in a safe way. That fix is DIP1000. It&#8217;s the reason why this example already causes a deprecation warning by default if it&#8217;s compiled with the latest nightly dmd.</p>\n<h2 id="bornfirstdeadlast">Born first, dead last</h2>\n<p>DIP1000 is a set of enhancements to the language rules regarding pointers, slices, and other references. The name stands for <a href="https://github.com/dlang/DIPs">D Improvement Proposal</a> number 1000, <a href="https://github.com/dlang/DIPs/blob/master/DIPs/other/DIP1000.md">as that document is what</a> the new rules were initially based on. One can enable the new rules with the preview compiler switch, <code>-preview=dip1000</code>. Existing code may need some changes to work with the new rules, which is why the switch is not enabled by default. It&#8217;s going to be the default in the future, so it&#8217;s best to enable it where possible and work to make code compatible with it where not.</p>\n<p>The basic idea is to let people limit the lifetime of a reference (an array or pointer, for example). A pointer to the stack is not dangerous if it does not exist longer than the stack variable it is pointing to. Regular references continue to exist, but they can refer only to data with an unlimited lifetime&mdash;that is, garbage collected memory, or <code>static</code> or global variables.</p>\n<h3 id="letsgetstarted">Let&#8217;s get started</h3>\n<p>The simplest way to construct limited lifetime references is to assign to it something with a limited lifetime.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe int* test(int arg1, int arg2)\n{\n    int* notScope = new int(5);\n    int* thisIsScope = &amp;arg1;\n    int* alsoScope; // Not initially scope...\n    alsoScope = thisIsScope; // ...but this makes it so.\n\n    // Error! The variable declared earlier is\n    // considered to have a longer lifetime,\n    // so disallowed.\n    thisIsScope = alsoScope;\n\n    return notScope; // ok\n    return thisIsScope; // error\n    return alsoScope; // error\n}</pre>\n<p>When testing these examples, remember to use the compiler switch <code>-preview=dip1000</code> and to mark the function <code>@safe</code>. The checks are not done for non-<code>@safe</code> functions.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/attribute.html#scope">the <code>scope</code> keyword</a> can be explicitly used to limit the lifetime of a reference.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe int[] test()\n{\n    int[] normalRef;\n    scope int[] limitedRef;\n\n    if(true)\n    {\n        int[5] stackData = [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5];\n\n        // Lifetime of stackData ends\n        // before limitedRef, so this is\n        // disallowed.\n        limitedRef = stackData[];\n\n        //This is how you do it\n        scope int[] evenMoreLimited\n            = stackData[];\n    }\n\n    return normalRef; // Okay.\n    return limitedRef; // Forbidden.\n}</pre>\n<p>If we can&#8217;t return limited lifetime references, how they are used at all? Easy. Remember, only the address of the data is protected, not the data itself. It means that we have many ways to pass scoped data out of the function.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe int[] fun()\n{\n    scope int[] dontReturnMe = [1,2,3];\n\n    int[] result = new int[](dontReturnMe.length);\n    // This copies the data, instead of having\n    // result refer to protected memory.\n    result[] = dontReturnMe[];\n    return result;\n\n    // Shorthand way of doing the same as above\n    return dontReturnMe.dup;\n\n    // Also you are not always interested\n    // in the contents as a whole; you\n    // might want to calculate something else\n    // from them\n    return\n    [\n        dontReturnMe[0] * dontReturnMe[1],\n        cast(int) dontReturnMe.length\n    ];\n}</pre>\n<h3 id="gettinginterprocedural">Getting interprocedural</h3>\n<p>With the tricks discussed so far, DIP1000 would be restricted to language primitives when handling limited lifetime references, but the <code>scope</code> storage class can be applied to function parameters, too. Because this guarantees the memory won&#8217;t be used after the function exits, local data references can be used as arguments to <code>scope</code> parameters.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe double average(scope int[] data)\n{\n    double result = 0;\n    foreach(el; data) result += el;\n    return result / data.length;\n}\n\n@safe double use()\n{\n    int[10] data = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];\n    return data[].average; // works!\n}</pre>\n<p>Initially, it&#8217;s probably best to keep <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/function.html#function-attribute-inference">attribute auto inference</a> off. Auto inference in general is a good tool, but it silently adds <code>scope</code> attributes to all parameters it can, meaning it&#8217;s easy to lose track of what&#8217;s happening. That makes the learning process a lot harder. Avoid this by always explicitly specifying the return type (or lack thereof with <code>void</code> or <code>noreturn</code>): <code>@safe const(char[]) fun(int* val)</code> as opposed to <code>@safe auto fun(int* val)</code> or <code>@safe const fun(int* val)</code>. The function also must not be a template or inside a template. We&#8217;ll dig deeper on <code>scope</code> auto inference in a future post.</p>\n<p><code>scope</code> allows handling pointers and arrays that point to the stack, but forbids returning them. What if that&#8217;s the goal? Enter the <code>return scope</code> attribute:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">//Being character arrays, strings also work with DIP1000.\n@safe string latterHalf(return scope string arg)\n{\n    return arg[$/2 .. $];\n}\n\n@safe string test()\n{\n    // allocated in static program memory\n    auto hello1 = "Hello world!";\n    // allocated on the stack, copied from hello1\n    immutable(char)[12] hello2 = hello1;\n\n    auto result1 = hello1.latterHalf; // ok\n    return result1; // ok\n\n    auto result2 = hello2[].latterHalf; // ok\n    // Nice try! result2 is scope and can\'t\n    // be returned.\n    return result2;\n}</pre>\n<p><code>return scope</code> parameters work by checking if any of the arguments passed to them are <code>scope</code>. If so, the return value is treated as a <code>scope</code> value that may not outlive any of the <code>return scope</code> arguments. If none are <code>scope</code>, the return value is treated as a global reference that can be copied freely. Like <code>scope</code>, <code>return scope</code> is conservative. Even if one does not actually return the address protected by <code>return scope</code>, the compiler will still perform the call site lifetime checks just as if one did.</p>\n<h3 id="scopeisshallow"><code>scope</code> is shallow</h3>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe void test()\n{\n    scope a = "first";\n    scope b = "second";\n    string[] arr = [a, b];\n}</pre>\n<p>In <code>test</code>, initializing <code>arr</code> does not compile. This may be surprising given that the language automatically adds <code>scope</code> to a variable on initialization if needed.</p>\n<p>However, consider what the <code>scope</code> on <code>scope string[] arr</code> would protect. There are two things it could potentially protect: the addresses of the strings in the array, or the addresses of the characters in the strings. For this assignment to be safe, <code>scope</code> would have to protect the characters in the strings, but it only protects the top-level reference, i.e., the strings in the array. Thus, the example does not work. Now change <code>arr</code> so that it&#8217;s a static array:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe void test()\n{\n    scope a = "first";\n    scope b = "second";\n    string[2] arr = [a, b];\n}</pre>\n<p>This works because static arrays are not references. Memory for all of their elements is allocated in place on the stack (i.e., they <em>contain</em> their elements), as opposed to dynamic arrays which contain a reference to elements stored elsewhere. When a static array is <code>scope</code>, its elements are treated as <code>scope</code>. And since the example would not compile were <code>arr</code> not <code>scope</code>, it follows that <code>scope</code> is inferred.</p>\n<h2 id="somepracticaltips">Some practical tips</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s face it, the DIP1000 rules take time to understand, and many would rather spend that time coding something useful. The first and most important tip is: avoid non-<code>@safe</code> code like the plague if doable. Of course, this advice is not new, but it appears even more important with DIP1000. In a nutshell, the language does not check the validity of <code>scope</code> and <code>return scope</code> in a non-<code>@safe</code> function, <em>but</em> when calling those functions the compiler assumes that the attributes are respected.</p>\n<p>This makes <code>scope</code> and <code>return scope</code> terrible footguns in unsafe code. But by resisting the temptation to mark code <code>@trusted</code> to avoid thinking, a D coder can hardly do damage. Misusing DIP1000 in <code>@safe</code> code can cause needless compilation errors, but it won&#8217;t corrupt memory and is unlikely to cause other bugs either.</p>\n<p>A second important point worth mentioning is that there is no need for <code>scope</code> and <code>return scope</code> for function attributes if they receive only static or GC-allocated data. Many langauges do not let coders refer to the stack at all; just because D programmers can do so does not mean they must. This way, they don&#8217;t have to spend any more time solving compiler errors than they did before DIP1000. And if a desire to work with the stack arises after all, the authors can then return to annotate the functions. Most likely they will accomplish this without breaking the interface.</p>\n<h2 id="whatsnext">What&#8217;s next?</h2>\n<p>This concludes today&#8217;s blog post. This is enough to know how to use arrays and pointers with DIP1000. In principle, it also enables readers to use DIP1000 with classes and interfaces. The only thing to learn is that a class reference, including the <code>this</code> pointer in member functions, works with DIP1000 just like a pointer would. Still, it&#8217;s hard to grasp what that means from one sentence, so later posts shall illustrate the subject.</p>\n<p>In any case, there is more to know. DIP1000 has some features for <code>ref</code> function parameters, structs, and unions that we didn&#8217;t cover here. We&#8217;ll also dig deeper on how DIP1000 plays with non-<code>@safe</code> functions and attribute auto inference. Currently, the plan is to do two more posts for this series.</p>\n<p>Do let us know in the comment section or the D forums if you have any useful DIP1000 tips that were not covered!</p>\n<p><em>Thanks to Walter Bright for reviewing this article.</em></p>'}]}

Early on, a major milestone release of GDC, the GCC-based D compiler, hit the virtual shelves. It was followed in middle of the month by the release of D 2.100.0 along with a DMD release, the reference D compiler, of the same version.

Finally, the latter half of the month saw <a href="https://dconf.org/2022/index.html#schedule">the publication of the DConf &#8217;22 schedule</a>, we found a sponsor for the DConf tradition of BeerConf, and May 31st marks <a href="https://dconf.org/2022/index.html#register">the final day of DConf &#8217;22 early-bird registration</a>.</p>\n<p><em>A video version of this blog post is available on <a href="https://youtu.be/qTH1S6z-n-s">the D Language Foundation YouTube channel</a>.</em></p>\n<h2 id="d2.100.0">D 2.100.0</h2>\n<p><a href="https://dlang.org/changelog/2.100.0.html">This latest release of DMD</a> comes to us courtesy of 41 contributors who brought us 22 major changes and 179 fixed Bugzilla issues. Although the community attached a bit of significance to the 2.100.0 version number, there isn&#8217;t anything overly exciting in the changelog. This is largely a house-cleaning release&mdash;a number of deprecation periods that should have already ended have been terminated&mdash; but there are a couple of interesting additions to the language.</p>\n<h3 id="d1-styleopertatoroverloading">D1-style operator overloading</h3>\n<p>One of these is <a href="https://dlang.org/changelog/2.100.0.html#d1_style_operators">the deprecation of D1-style operator overloads</a>. Originally, these were designed to make their purpose clear. Want to overload the addition operator? Then implement <code>opAdd</code>. What to overload the multiplication operator? Then implement <code>opMul</code>. Walter took this approach with operator overloading because of one of the major complaints about the feature in C++: people often overload an operator to do something different from what it is expected to do. An example: overloading the <code>+</code> operator to append rather than perform addition. Walter&#8217;s reasoning was that if the intent of the operator is included in the name of the function, then anyone overloading it to do something different is essentially violating its contract. Perhaps it would encourage people to stick to the intent.</p>\n<p>No one can say for sure if Walter&#8217;s approach worked like he hoped, but <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/operatoroverloading.html">a more generic design was implemented in D2</a>, and this is the approach all D code must use today. The D1 operators were kept around largely to ease porting D1 code to D2, with the intention that they would one day be deprecated. <a href="https://dlang.org/changelog/2.088.0.html">It finally happened in D 2.088.0</a>, which was released in the fall of 2019. <a href="https://github.com/dlang/DIPs/blob/master/DIPs/accepted/DIP1013.md">Following the deprecation process</a>, the deprecation period should have ended with 2.098.0 (the first release after 10 non-patch releases including the deprecation).</p>\n<h3 id="delete">delete</h3>\n<p>The <code>delete</code> keyword was another D1 feature that was ultimately axed in D2. It <a href="https://dlang.org/changelog/2.079.0.html">was deprecated in D 2.079.0</a>, which was released in the spring of 2018. This was something that had long been planned (<a href="https://dlang.org/deprecate.html#delete">see the deprecation page for the rationale</a>), and its use had been discouraged for some time.</p>\n<p>N<code>delete</code> would both destroy an object instance (call its destructors) and release the memory allocated for it by the GC. Now, we use the <code>destroy</code> function from the <code>object</code> module which is imported by default in all D programs. This will call the destructor on an instance and optionally reset the instance to its default <code>.init</code> state. The GC will then free the memory allocated for the instance when necessary, or the programmer can do it manually via <code>GC.free</code> static member function in <code>core.memory</code>.</p>\n<h3 id="mustuse">@mustuse</h3>\n<p><a href="https://github.com/dlang/DIPs/blob/master/DIPs/accepted/DIP1038.md">Paul Backus took DIP 1038</a> through the review process from beginning to end. Initially, it introduced an <code>@nodiscard</code> attribute for functions and types. During the Formal Assessment after the review rounds were completed, Walter and Átila were willing to approve it with changes. The final version renamed the attribute to <code>@mustUse</code> and restricted its application to structs and unions.</p>\n<p><a href="https://dlang.org/changelog/2.100.0.html#mustUse">The feature was implemented in D 2.100.0</a> as <code>@mustuse</code>, and is now available to use in your D code. When a type marked with the attribute is the result of an expression, the result cannot be ignored.</p>\n<h3 id=".tupleofforstaticarrays">.tupleof for static arrays</h3>\n<p>Many D programmers are familiar with the <code>.tupleof</code> property of structs, which is particularly useful when interfacing with C libraries:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">struct Circle {\n    float x, y;\n    float radius;\n    ubyte r, g, b, a;\n}\n\n@nogc nothrow\nextern(C) void draw_circle (\n    float cx, float cy, float radius,\n    ubyte r, ubyte g, ubyte b, ubyte a\n);\n\nvoid foo() {\n    Circle c = makeCircle();\n    draw_circle(c.tupleof);\n}</pre>\n<p>Now we can <a href="https://dlang.org/changelog/2.100.0.html#static_array_tupleof">do the same thing with static arrays</a>:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">void foo(int, int, int) { /* ... */ }\n\nint[3] ia = [1, 2, 3];\nfoo(ia.tupleof); // same as `foo(1, 2, 3);\n\nfloat[3] fa;\n//fa = ia; // error\nfa.tupleof = ia.tupleof;\nassert(fa == [1F, 2F, 3F]);</pre>\n<h2 id="dconf22">DConf &#8217;22</h2>\n<p>DConf &#8217;22 is happening in London, August 1&nbsp;4.

The schedule is online and BeerConf is a go!</p>\n<h3 id="dconf22schedule">DConf &#8217;22 schedule</h3>\n<p>We love to see and hear first-time speakers at DConf, whether it&#8217;s their first conference talk ever or their first DConf talk. This year, we have 11 first-time DConf speakers, 12 if you include our invited keynote speaker Roberto Ierusalimschy (<a href="http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/en/teacher/@roberto-ierusalimschy">the head designer of the Lua programming language</a>). This is awesome!</p>\n<p><a href="https://dconf.org/2022/index.html#schedule">The DConf &#8217;22 schedule</a> is set up as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>three keynotes: two from the language maintainers, one from our guest speaker</li>\n<li>two panels: the traditional DConf Ask Us Anything involving the language maintainers, and a panel on Programming Language Design</li>\n<li>a Lightning Talks session</li>\n<li>15 presentations (11 of which are from first-time DConf speakers)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We&#8217;re limiting the talks to 45 minutes this year so that we&#8217;ll have more time to mingle between sessions. One of the talks on Day 3 is slated for 25&#8211;30 minutes, so we&#8217;ve slotted it such that we have a longer lunch that day.</p>\n<p>The schedule (excluding the keynotes, as the details of those haven&#8217;t yet been provided) has a loose theme. It&#8217;s not perfect, but it&#8217;ll do:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Day One is mostly status reports and tutorials</li>\n<li>Day Two is largely intermediate to advanced and heavy on the tech</li>\n<li>Day Three is about the D ecosystem</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of the talks will be livestreamed and recorded, so they&#8217;ll be available on our YouTube channel at some point after the conference has ended. Still, DConf is about more than just the talks, <a href="https://youtu.be/nvo7wzjVDQc">as Razvan Nitu and Dennis Korpel noted in an interview</a>. It&#8217;s about getting to know in person the people we encounter online in our regular D community interactions. As Razvan said and I can attest, your perspective will surely change after you can match the internet handles with living, breathing, human beings with whom you&#8217;ve interacted in person.</p>\n<p><a href="https://dconf.org/2022/index.html#register">So register</a>!</p>\n<h3 id="early-birdregistrationends">Early-bird registration ends</h3>\n<p><a href="https://dconf.org/2022/index.html#register">May 31st is the last day of early-bird registration</a>.

We can&#8217;t help you with transportation, just the registration.</p>\n<h3 id="beerconf">BeerConf</h3>\n<p>BeerConf is a DConf tradition going back to the very beginning, though we didn&#8217;t call it that back then. Every year, we would designate an &#8220;official&#8221; hotel somewhere in the vicinity of the venue. This would be our gathering spot in the evenings, usually in the hotel lobby or bar. Typically, would people break off into groups for dinner, then several of them would wander over to the gathering spot to hang out and chat, usually over beers. At DConf 2017, Ethan Watson branded this gathering BeerConf and the name has stuck.</p>\n<p>At DConf 2019 in London, we couldn&#8217;t find a suitable hotel to select as the site of BeerConf. Instead, we hired out the upper floor of a pub close to the venue, thanks to the sponsorship of Mercedes Benz Research and Development North America. For DConf &#8217;22, we&#8217;re back in the same general area, and so we again have to hire out a pub.</p>\n<p>The 2019 pub was a bit crowded for us, and is a bit too far of a walk from our &#8217;22 venue, so we&#8217;ve got our eyes on another pub within walking distance of the venue and near <a href="https://dconf.org/2022/index.html#venue">some of the budget hotels listed at dconf.org</a>. What we&#8217;ve been missing is funding.</p>\n<p>That has changed, <a href="https://funkwerk.com/en/?noredirect=en-US">thanks to Funkwerk</a>! With their sponsorship, we&#8217;re able to cover the minimum spend the pub asks for the each of the evenings of August 1&nbsp;3. This means that DConf attendees dropping by this pub on those nights can order food and drinks (alcoholic and or otherwise) for free until the DConf tab runs out. We&#8217;ll have a separate tab for each night so that we don&#8217;t blow it all in one go.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t announce the specifics about the pub just yet. <a href="https://symmetryinvestments.com/">Our DConf host, Symmetry Investments</a>, is handling the arrangements for us since they&#8217;re in London and we aren&#8217;t. Once I receive confirmation that the deal is set, I&#8217;ll announce all of the details in the forums, here on the blog, and at dconf.org. So keep your ears open!</p>\n<p>Thanks again to Funkwerk for helping us out.</p>\n<h2 id="nexttime">Next time</h2>\n<p>The next big news roundup will come in late August or early September, but I&#8217;ll keep the blog updated with announcements before DConf as they come. If you are planning to attend DConf, then I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing you in London. And if you aren&#8217;t, then change your plans!</p>'}]}

Three of them were unable to make it to the end. So it came down to two: Teodor Dutu and Luís Ferreira. Teodor was working on converting DRuntime hooks to templates, and Luís on getting support for D into LLDB, the LLVM debugger.</p>\n<p>SAOC is sponsored by Symmetry Investments. Each year, participants promise to work on their projects at least 20 hours per week across four month-long milestones. At the end of each of the first three milestones, a panel of judges evaluates their progress to decide if they pass or fail. A passing participant is awarded a $1000 payment and allowed to continue in the next milestone. A failing participant might be given a reduced payment or none at all, and removed from the event or given a warning, depending on the circumstances leading to the failure. At the end of the fourth milestone, the judges evaluate the overall progress of each participant across the entire event and select one to receive a final $1000 payment and a free trip to DConf.</p>\n<p>For the first time in four editions of the event, the SOAC 2021 judges were unable to agree on who should receive the final rewards. It was a three-judge panel, each of whom is a veteran of every edition of SAOC: Jon Colvin, Átila Neves, and Robert Schadek. Two of them split, and the third felt there wasn&#8217;t enough to make either of the two participants stand out above the other. Teodor and Luís both did their work, wrote detailed milestone reports, and kept up with their forum updates to the same degree. So the conflicted judge took a proposal to Laeeth Isharc of Symmetry: why not award both candidates the final payment and the DConf trip?</p>\n<p>Congratulations to Teodor and Luís on being the first dual recipients of the final SAOC reward. They have continued working on their projects, and we look forward to seeing the work they do in the future. Thanks to all of the SAOC participants, mentors, and judges, and to Symmetry Investments for sponsoring the event every year.</p>\n<h2 id="thenewpullrequestandissuemanager">The New Pull Request and Issue Manager</h2>\n<p>For over a year, Razvan Nitu has been working hard at closing Bugzilla issues and merging pull requests in his role as our Pull Request and Issue Manager. His position is sponsored by Symmetry Investments, which provided funding for two such positions. Unfortunately, real-world circumstances conspired to prevent the person selected for the second position from filling it, so it remained vacant through most of 2021.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of this year, Symmetry committed to continuing funding for both positions (as well as a different position, that of my assistant, filled by Max Haughton). In January, we put out a call for applications. In February, we announced that Dennis Korpel was selected for the job. His proven track record as a volunteer contributor to the core D repositories made him the top contender.</p>\n<p>Dennis officially started his new job on March 1, and he hit the ground running.

That&#8217;s what they&#8217;re here for.</p>\n<p>One way you can do that is by tweeting the issue number along with <strong>#dbugfix</strong>. We initiated this hashtag a while back so that D users could bring attention to specific issues, but then the hard part was finding someone with the time and inclination to fix it. Now, with both Razvan and Dennis paid to make sure issues get fixed, the hard part is a lot easier. You can also post about issues in the forums or email social@dlang.org, and I will make sure that they see it.</p>\n<p>Razvan and Dennis have their criteria for deciding their priorities in the absence of input, but if you bring an issue or PR to their attention, they will work to resolve it as quickly as they can.</p>\n<h2 id="d2.099.0">D 2.099.0</h2>\n<p>Version 2.099.0 of DMD, the reference D compiler, was released on March 6. This is a <em>massive</em> release, containing 20 major changes and 221 closed Bugzilla issues from 100 contributors. Some highlights from this release: D modules can be imported into C code via ImportC; D now has <em>throw expressions</em>; and PE/COFF output is now the default in DMD on Windows. <a href="https://dlang.org/changelog/2.099.0.html">See the changelog</a> for the complete list.</p>\n<h3 id="importmodulesincsourcecodewithimportc">Import modules in C source code with ImportC</h3>\n<p>ImportC is proving to be a valuable addition to D. Once all the kinks are ironed out and a solution for handling C preprocessor directives is implemented, the need for bindings to C libraries will largely disappear&mdash;you&#8217;ll be able to bring C headers, and compile C source files, directly into your D programs without any external tools.</p>\n<p>As of D 2.099.0, you can also <a href="https://dlang.org/changelog/2.099.0.html#__import">bring D modules directly into C files</a> via the <code>__import</code> keyword.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">// dsayhello.d\nimport core.stdc.stdio : puts;\n\nextern(C) void helloImport() {\n    puts(&quot;Hello __import!&quot;);\n}</pre>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-c_cpp">// dhelloimport.c\n__import dsayhello;\n__import core.stdc.stdio : puts;\n\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\n    helloImport();\n    puts(&quot;Cool, eh?&quot;);\n    return 0;\n}</pre>\n<p>Compile with:</p>\n<pre>dmd dhelloimport.c dsayhello.d</pre>\n<p>You can also use it to import C modules that have been compiled via ImportC:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-c_cpp">// csayhello.c\n__import core.stdc.stdio : puts;\n\nvoid helloImport() {\n    puts(&quot;Hello _import!&quot;);\n}</pre>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-c_cpp">// chelloimport.c\n__import csayhello;\n__import core.stdc.stdio : puts;\n\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\n    helloImport();\n    puts(&quot;Cool, eh?&quot;);\n    return 0;\n}</pre>\n<p>Compile with:</p>\n<pre>dmd chelloimport.c csayhello.c</pre>\n<h3 id="thethrowexpressionhasbeenimplemented">The throw expression has been implemented</h3>\n<p>For all of D&#8217;s lifetime, <code>throw</code> has been a statement and only a statement. It couldn&#8217;t be used in expressions because expressions must have a type, and since <code>throw</code> doesn&#8217;t return a value, there was no suitable type. This prevented it from being used with the following syntax:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">(string err) =&gt; throw new Exception(err);</pre>\n<p>And required this form instead:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">(string err) { throw new Exception(err); }</pre>\n<p>DIP 1034, which introduced a bottom type to the language, <a href="https://github.com/dlang/DIPs/blob/master/DIPs/accepted/DIP1034.md#flow-analysis-across-functions">provided the means to enable throw expressions</a>: when &#8220;a throw statement is seen as an expression returning a bottom type&#8221;. As of D 2.099.0, <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/expression.html#throw_expression">the following code snippet compiles</a>:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">void foo(int function() f) {}\n\nvoid main() {\n    foo(() =&gt; throw new Exception());\n}</pre>\n<h3 id="pecoffisthedefaultdmdoutputonwindows">PE/COFF is the default DMD output on Windows</h3>\n<p>For many years, DMD outputs object files in the OMF format on Windows. There&#8217;s a story behind this, a large part of it related to the culture of software development on Windows, but it can be summarized in two bullet points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Walter Bright already had a C compiler backend that generated OMF output, a license to distribute OMF link libraries for the Win32 API, and a linker that understands OMF (OPTLINK).</li>\n<li>There was no de facto system linker on Windows when he started working on D in 1999, so he could not rely on a specific linker being installed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reusing the compiler backend and the linker allowed Walter to distribute DMD as a compiler that worked out of the box, without the need to install any further development tools. He felt this was important for D&#8217;s early adoption. The downside was that it also restricted DMD on Windows to 32-bit. Eventually, he had to support PE/COFF and require the Microsoft linker in order to support 64-bit output, and he implemented PE/COFF 32-bit at the same time, but he was adamant that DMD continue to work out of the box for those who didn&#8217;t want to install the Microsoft Build Tools (for the linker) and Windows SDK (for the Win32 link libraries).</p>\n<p>Eventually, OPTLINK started showing its age. Linker errors became more common as D codebases grew. There were calls to enable PE/COFF by default. Finally, someone raised the idea of shipping <a href="https://lld.llvm.org/">the LLVM linker, LLD</a>, along with link libraries generated from <a href="https://www.mingw-w64.org/">the MinGW project</a>. This would allow DMD to eventually default to PE/COFF while maintaining the out-of-the-box experience.</p>\n<p>DMD has been shipping with LLD for several releases, and it seems enough of the kinks have been worked out that it has been ready to become the default for a while now. Nicholas Wilson finally took the step to make that happen, Walter eventually gave it his blessing, and now PE/COFF is the default DMD output on Windows.</p>\n<p>Practically, this means that the <code>-m32mscoff</code> switch has been deprecated, <code>-m32</code> now specifies PE/COFF, and the new switch <code>-m32omf</code> can be used to produce OMF output if needed (but its OMF support will eventually be dropped). The <code>-m64</code> switch has always produced PE/COFF output, so has not changed.</p>\n<h3 id="ldc">LDC</h3>\n<p>The beta release of LDC 1.29.0 <a href="https://forum.dlang.org/post/tgvvhqvyugfrsdhuhiyo@forum.dlang.org">was announced on March 10</a>. This version of the LLVM-based D compiler is based on D 2.099.0+. It includes support for LLVM 13, no longer defaults to the <code>ld.gold</code> linker on Linux (LLD is recommended), and includes a breaking change for the <code>extern(D)</code> ABI.

We&#8217;re excited that he&#8217;s able to join us. Several D community members have used or are using Lua in their D projects, including the gas dynamics toolkit at the University of Queensland that <a href="https://dlang.org/blog/2022/02/02/a-gas-dynamics-toolkit-in-d/">its maintainers wrote about on this blog</a>. (You can also count me in that group.

The base early-bird rate is $352.75 ($423.30 after applying 20% VAT), which is 15% off the general registration of $415 ($498 with 20% VAT). We offer a student discount, a discount for major open source contributors, and a hardship rate. You can <a href="https://dconf.org/2022/index.html#register">register now or learn about the discounted rates at dconf.org</a>.</p>\n<h3 id="talks">Talks</h3>\n<p>At past editions of DConf, we&#8217;ve allotted talks in 50-minute blocks with 10-minute breaks in between. This year, we&#8217;re cutting that down: we&#8217;d like to keep the talks no longer than 40&ndash;45 minutes. Part of the magic of DConf is the time spent interacting face-to-face with other D enthusiasts, so it only makes sense to make as much room for that as we can while still allowing for educational and informative presentations.</p>\n<p>If you have something related to the D programming language that you&#8217;d like to share with the world, please send in a submission. Don&#8217;t know what to talk about? Then heed Ali Çehreli, <a href="https://youtu.be/E-78QqeDfI8?t=21">from one of his DConf Online 2020 Q &amp; A sessions</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nComing up with an idea for a talk is as simple as the way you use D. Just look at your code, and it makes a presentation&#8230;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you have used the D programming language, then you have material for a talk: describe your project; talk about specific problems you solved or interesting ways in which you&#8217;ve employed language features; expound on the ups and downs of your experience learning D so that others can benefit; and so on. Take a look at the DConf and DConf Online talks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDLanguageFoundation/playlists">available on our YouTube channel</a> for inspiration. Even if you&#8217;ve never presented at a conference, we encourage you to send us a submission! Several D community members have given their first presentation at DConf, and we are always happy to see more.</p>\n<p>The worst that can happen when you submit a talk is that it isn&#8217;t accepted. But if it <em>is</em> accepted, then you&#8217;ll be entitled to reimbursement for your transportation to and from London, and your lodging for the five nights of the conference. You get to hang out with people who share your interest in D and most of your expenses are covered, with nothing to lose if your talk isn&#8217;t accepted.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t let doubt or hesitation hold you back.

All of our talks will be in their CTRL room on the first floor, and we&#8217;ll have the basement ESC room to ourselves for mingling between talks and during lunch. They have table tennis and foosball tables, and plenty of space in which to chill.</p>\n<p>CodeNode isn&#8217;t far from our DConf 2019 venue, so the same budget hotels we stayed at then are also within walking distance this year.

Many attendees would take rooms there, and a number of us would gather in the evenings in the hotel lobby or bar to chat over drinks and snacks. In one of our Berlin editions, Ethan Watson coined the term &#8220;BeerConf&#8221; to refer to these evening meetups. In 2019, we couldn&#8217;t find a suitable hotel in which to gather, so we hired space in a pub near the venue. When DConf was canceled in 2020, a couple of community members hosted an online BeerConf to make up for the loss of the real-world version, and <a href="https://wiki.dlang.org/Beerconf">they&#8217;ve been hosting it every month since</a>.</p>\n<p>This year, since we&#8217;re back in the same part of London, we&#8217;re again looking for a space we can rent for BeerConf. We&#8217;ve got our eyes on a couple of spaces, and we&#8217;re working to secure funding. I hope to have an update on that before the end of April.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, keep an eye on <a href="https://forum.dlang.org/group/announce">the D Announce forum</a> for news of our monthly online version of BeerConf, and consider picking up a BeerConf shirt from <a href="https://www.zazzle.com/store/dlang_swag?rf=238129799288374326">our DLang Swag Emporium</a>!</p>\n<h2 id="lookingahead">Looking ahead</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;re looking forward to the rest of 2022. One of our big goals for this year is to lay the groundwork for bringing more structure and organization to the D ecosystem. The PR/Issue managers have made a big difference and brought order to a chaotic contribution process, but we still have a long way to get to where we&#8217;d like to be.</p>\n<p>Soon, I&#8217;ll start publishing tutorials on the foundation&#8217;s YouTube channel. These tutorials are going to cover more than just the language syntax and semantics. They&#8217;ll also dive into the tools we use as D programmers: compilers, linkers, loaders, object files, etc. These days, it&#8217;s not unsual for a programmer new to D to have gone years without ever touching a programming language that uses the same compile-link model. Questions about static linking errors, or confusion about compiler vs. linker errors, are not uncommon. These tutorials will be short and focused on specific topics, and will hopefully serve as a means for new D programmers to up their game with the tools they use.</p>\n<p>Once I&#8217;ve uploaded the tutorials, I&#8217;ll apply for our channel to join the YouTube Partner Program so that we can start raising money from the channel. We&#8217;re eligible now, but I don&#8217;t want to apply until I&#8217;ve established a more frequent pattern of updates.</p>\n<p>On that note, I&#8217;d like to remind you that the D Language Foundation is available to select as a charity for the Amazon Smile program.

They allow the programmer to generate efficient and correct code at compile time. Long gone are the days of preprocessor macros or handwritten, per-type data structures. D templates, though designed in the shadow of C++ templates, were not made in their image. D makes templates cleaner and more expressive, and also enables patterns like &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdzwvY8Mo-w">Design by Introspection</a>&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Here is a simple example of a template that would require the use of preprocessor macros in C or C++:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">template sizeOfTypeByName(string name)\n{\n  enum sizeOfTypeByName = mixin(name, ".sizeof");\n}\nunittest\n{\n  assert(sizeOfTypeByName!"int" == 4);\n}</pre>\n<p>D&#8217;s templates are powerful tools but should not be used unthinkingly. Carelessness could result in long compile times or excessive code generation.</p>\n<p>In this blog post, I introduce some simple concepts that can help in writing templates that minimize resource usage. Deeper intuition can also lead to the discovery of new abstractions or increased confidence in existing ones.</p>\n<h2 id="readthememo">Read the memo</h2>\n<p>The D compiler memoizes template instantiations: if I instantiate <code>MyTemplate!int</code> once, the compiler produces an AST for that instantiation; if I instantiate that exact template again, the previous computation is reused.</p>\n<p>As a demonstration, let&#8217;s write a generic addition function and use <code>pragma(msg, ...)</code> to print the number of instantiations at compile time. I&#8217;m going to use it twice with integers and twice with floating point numbers.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">auto genericAdd(T)(const T x, const T y)\n{\n  pragma(msg, "genericAdd instantiated with ", T);\n  return x + y;\n}\n\n// Instantiate with int\nwriteln(genericAdd!int(4, 5));\nwriteln(genericAdd!int(6, 1));\n\n// Now for the float type\nwriteln(genericAdd!float(24.0, 32.0));\nwriteln(genericAdd!float(0.0, float.nan));</pre>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s compile the code and look at what our <code>pragma(msg, )</code> says about template instantiations in the compiler.</p>\n<pre>dmd -c generic_add.d</pre>\n<p>This yields the following output during compilation:</p>\n<pre>genericAdd instantiated with int\ngenericAdd instantiated with float</pre>\n<p>We can see <code>int</code> and <code>float</code> as we expected, but notice that each is only mentioned once. Newcomers to languages with templates or generics can sometimes mistakenly think that using a template requires a potentially expensive instantiation on every use in the source code. For the benefit of those new users of D, the above is categoric proof that this is not the case; you <em>cannot</em> pay twice for templates you have already asked the compiler to instantiate. (You can, however, convince yourself that you <em>are</em> asking the compiler to do something it&#8217;s already done when you in fact are not. We&#8217;ll go over contrived and real-world examples of this later in this article.)</p>\n<p>The benefit of this feature should be obvious, but what may not be obvious is how it can be employed in writing templates. Within the bounds of our desire for ergonomics, we should design the <em>interfaces</em> of our templates to maximize the number of identical instantiations.</p>\n<h2 id="whatsinaname">What&#8217;s in a name?</h2>\n<p>The following example, adapted from a real-world change to a large D project, yielded a reduction in compile time of a few percent for unit-test builds.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say we have an expensive template whose behavior we want to test over a simple type. Our type might be:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">struct Vector3\n{\n  float x;\n  float y;\n  float z;\n}</pre>\n<p>To demonstrate the phenomenon, we don&#8217;t have to do anything fancy, so we&#8217;ll just declare a stub called <code>send</code>.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">// Let\'s say this sends a value of type T to a database.\nvoid send(T)(T x);</pre>\n<p><strong>A note on syntax:</strong> Given a variable <code>val</code> of type <code>int</code>, this template could be explicitly instantiated as <code>send!(int)(val)</code>. However, the compiler can infer the type <code>T</code>, so we can instantiate it as if it were a normal function call as <code>send(val)</code>. Using D&#8217;s <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/function.html#pseudo-member">Uniform Function Call Syntax</a>, we could alternatively call it like a property or member, as <code>val.send()</code> (the approach used in the following example), or even <code>val.send</code>, since parentheses are optional in function calls when there are no arguments.</p>\n<p>Our test might then be something like:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">struct Vector3\n{\n  float x;\n  float y;\n  float z;\n}\n\nunittest\n{\n  Vector3 value;\n  value.send();\n}</pre>\n<p>This is reasonable so far. However, an issue arises when we start to write more than one test. Should we want to test different behaviors of a fancy template, but instantiate it with the same type, then we end up spending more time in compilation than we would have expected. A lot more time. And we see large growth in the number of symbols emitted in the resulting binary, resulting in a larger file size than one would expect. Why is that?</p>\n<p>Despite our intuition that the compiler should consider multiple declarations of a type like <code>Vector3</code> in multiple <code>unittest</code> blocks as identical, it actually does not. We can demonstrate this effect with an extremely simple example. We&#8217;ll provide an implementation of <code>send</code> that prints at compile time the type of each instantiation. Then <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/version.html#staticforeach">we&#8217;ll use <code>static foreach</code></a> to generate five distinct implementations of a single unit test.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">void send(T)(T x)\n{\n  pragma(msg, T); \n}\n\n// Generate 5 unittest blocks\nstatic foreach(_; 0..5)\n{\n  unittest\n  {\n    struct JustInt\n    {\n      int x;\n    }\n    JustInt value;\n    value.send;\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>This results in the following output from the compiler:</p>\n<pre>JustInt\nJustInt\nJustInt\nJustInt\nJustInt</pre>\n<p>Huh? Doesn&#8217;t this violate our &#8220;you can&#8217;t pay twice&#8221; rule? If you were to take this output from the compiler as gospel, then yes, but there&#8217;s a more subtle truth here.</p>\n<h2 id="fullyqualifiednames">Fully qualified names</h2>\n<p>The name of a type as you would write it in your editor is not the complete name of a type. Let&#8217;s amend the implementation of <code>send</code> to print the return value of a template called <code>fullyQualifiedName</code> rather than printing <code>T</code> directly. The rest of the example remains the same.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">void send(T)(T x)\n{\n  import std.traits : fullyQualifiedName;\n  pragma(msg, fullyQualifiedName!T); \n}</pre>\n<p>Assuming the module is named <code>example</code>, this yields something like:</p>\n<pre>example.__unittest_L13_C3_1.JustInt\nexample.__unittest_L13_C3_2.JustInt\nexample.__unittest_L13_C3_3.JustInt\nexample.__unittest_L13_C3_4.JustInt\nexample.__unittest_L13_C3_5.JustInt</pre>\n<p>This explains our previous conundrum. By declaring the type <em>locally</em> in each test, we have actually declared a new type per test, each of which results in a new instantiation.</p>\n<p>A type&#8217;s fully qualified name includes the name of its enclosing scope (<code>{package-name.}module-name.{scope-name(s).}TypeName</code>). The compiler rewrites each <code>unittest</code> as a unique function with a generated name. We have five unique functions, each with its own local, distinct declaration of a <code>JustInt</code> type. And so we end up with five distinct types.</p>\n<p>We want to ensure that one instantiation is reused across <code>unittest</code> blocks. We do that by moving the declaration of <code>JustInt</code> to module scope, outside of the unit tests.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">struct JustInt\n{\n  int x;\n}\n\nstatic foreach(_; 0..5)\n{\n  unittest\n  {\n    JustInt value;\n    value.send;\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>The <code>send</code> template now prints:</p>\n<pre>example.JustInt</pre>\n<p>Much better.</p>\n<h3 id="someharddata">Some hard data</h3>\n<p>To collect some anecdata about the usefulness of these changes, we&#8217;ll look at compilation times and the size of compiled binaries. Since this template is <em>very</em> trivial, let&#8217;s generate a hundred copies of the same <code>unittest</code> rather than five so we can see a trend.</p>\n<p>On my system, timing the compilation of our programs shows the locally declared types took <strong>243ms</strong> to compile, but the version with a single global type declaration took <strong>159ms</strong> to compile. A difference of <strong>84ms</strong> is not all that much, sure, but in a large codebase, there may be <em>a lot</em> of these speedups waiting to be found. Any reduction in compile times is to be embraced, especially when it&#8217;s cumulative.</p>\n<p>As for binary size, I saw a savings of <code>69K</code> on disk. The quantity of machine code generated by the compiler is worth keeping a close eye on. Larger binaries mean more work for the linker, which in turn means more time waiting for builds to complete. The easiest job is the one you don&#8217;t have to do.</p>\n<h2 id="amorecomplexexample">A more complex example</h2>\n<p>The following example demonstrates a very simple but fundamental change to a template that yields an enormous improvement in compile times and other metrics.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say we have a fairly simple interpreter, and we want to expose functions in our D code to the scripts executed by our interpreter. We can do that with some sort of registration function, which we&#8217;ll call <code>register</code>.</p>\n<h3 id="thesignatureoftheregisterfunction">The signature of the register function</h3>\n<p>To prove the point I&#8217;m discussing, we don&#8217;t need to implement this function&mdash;its <em>interface</em> is what can cause a big slow down.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say our <code>register</code> function looks like this:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">// Context is something our hypothetical interpreter works with\nvoid register(alias func, string registeredName)(Context x); </pre>\n<p>It&#8217;s pretty reasonable, right? It takes a template alias parameter that specifies the function to call (a common idiom in D) and a template value parameter of type <code>string</code> that represents the name of the function as it is exposed to scripts. The implementation of <code>register</code> will presumably map the value of <code>registeredName</code> to the <code>func</code> alias, and then scripts can call the function using that value. Functions can be registered with, e.g., the following:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">\ncontext = createAContext();\ncontext.register!(writeln!string, "writeln")();</pre>\n<p>The scripts can call the Phobos <code>writeln</code> function template using the name <code>writeln</code>.</p>\n<h3 id="thecompile-timeperformanceoftheregistertemplate">The compile-time performance of the register template</h3>\n<p>The interface for <code>register</code> looks harmless, but it turns out that it has a significant impact on compile time. We can test this by registering some random functions. The actual contents of the functions don&#8217;t matter&mdash;this article is about template compile times, so we just want a baseline figure for roughly how much time the infrastructure templates take to compile rather than the code they are hooking together.</p>\n<p>Although we will pull the functions out of a hat, the thing that will drive our intuition is to realize that a small number of interfaces will likely be reused many times. We could start with a basket of interface stubs like this:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">int stub1(string) { return 1; }\n\nint stub2(string) { return 2; }\n\nint stub3(string) { return 3; }\n\n// etc.</pre>\n<p>More broadly, with a bunch of functions that have identical signatures and a bunch of functions with random parameter lists and return types, we can get a rough baseline. With the set of stubs I used, compile times ended up at roughly <strong>5</strong> seconds.</p>\n<p>So what happens if we move the compile-time parameters to run time? Since <code>registeredName</code> is a template value parameter, we can just move it into the function parameter list with no change. We have to handle the <code>func</code> parameter differently. Almost any symbol can bind at compile time to a template alias parameter, but symbols can&#8217;t bind at run time to function parameters. We have to use a function pointer instead. In that case, we can use the type of the referenced function as a template parameter.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">void register(FuncType)(Context x, FuncType ptr, string registeredName);</pre>\n<p>With this signature, the compile time drops to roughly <strong>1</strong> second.</p>\n<h3 id="whatsgoingon">What&#8217;s going on?</h3>\n<p>D is a fairly fast language to compile. Good decisions have been made over the lifetime of the language to make that possible. It is also the case that one can happily write slow-to-compile D code. Although we are choosing to ignore the compilation speeds of the non-infrastructure code to simplify the point being made, this can actually (in a certain sense) be the case in real projects, too. As such it is worthwhile to pay attention not to the quantity of metaprogramming being done <em>semantically</em> but rather the quantity of metaprogramming being performed <em>by the compiler</em>.</p>\n<p>In this case, with the first interface used for <code>register</code>, the compiler had no opportunity to reuse any instantiations. Because it accepted the registered functions as symbols, each instantiation was unique. By shifting instead to take the <em>type</em> of the registered function as a template parameter and a pointer to the function as a function parameter, the compiler could reuse instantiations. <code>stub1</code>, <code>stub2</code>, and <code>stub3</code> are distinct symbols, but they each have the same type of (<code>int function(string)</code>).</p>\n<p>To be clear, this is not an indictment of template alias parameters. There are good use cases for them (the Phobos algorithms API is an example). The point of this example is to show how the compile-time costs of unique template instantiations can be hidden. A decision about the trade-offs between compile-time and run-time performance can only be made if the programmer is aware there is a decision to make. So when implementing a template, consider how it will be used. If it&#8217;s going to end up creating many unique instantiations, then you can weigh the benefits of keeping that interface versus redesigning it to maximize reuse.</p>\n<h2 id="afalsefriend">A false friend</h2>\n<p>In linguistics, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_friend">a false friend</a> is a pair of words from two different languages that look the same but have different meanings. I&#8217;m going to abuse this term by using it to refer to a pair of programming patterns that actually result in the same program behavior, but via different routes through the language implementation, i.e., one of these patterns has, say, worse performance or compile times than the other.</p>\n<h3 id="asimpleexample:">A simple example:</h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say we have a library that exposes a template as part of its API, like this one that prints a string when a module is loaded during run-time initialization:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">template FunTemplate(string op)\n{\n  shared static this()\n  {\n    import std.stdio;\n    writeln(op);\n  }\n}\n\n// Use like this\nmixin FunTemplate!&quot;Hello from DLang&quot;;</pre>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s say we want to refactor the library in some way that it&#8217;s desirable to distinguish the name <code>FunTemplate</code> and its implementation. How would you go about doing that?</p>\n<p>One way would be to tack <code>Impl</code> onto the implementation name, then declare an eponymous template that aliases the shortened name to the implementation name and forwards the template argument like this:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">template FunTemplate(string op)\n{\n  alias FunTemplate = FunTemplateImpl!op;\n}</pre>\n<p>This does the job, but it also creates an additional instantiation for each different value of <code>op</code>, one instance of <code>FunTemplate</code>, and one of <code>FunTemplateImpl</code>. So if we instantiate it with, e.g., five different values, we end up with ten unique instantiations. Now imagine doing that with a template that&#8217;s heavily used throughout a program.</p>\n<p>Since we only want to provide an alternate name for the implementation and aren&#8217;t doing anything to the parameter list, we can achieve the same result without adding another template into the mix: just use <code>alias</code> by itself.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">alias FunTemplate = FunTemplateImpl; </pre>\n<p>Since <code>FunTemplate</code> is no longer a template, <code>FunTemplate!&quot;Foo&quot;</code> only creates the one instance of <code>FunTemplateImpl</code>.</p>\n<h2 id="normalizationoftemplatearguments">Normalization of template arguments</h2>\n<p>Once we know what we want a template to look like, and we&#8217;re satisfied with the interface we want it to have, there are sometimes subtle ways to separate the interface and implementation of a template such that we can minimize the total amount of work the compiler has to do.</p>\n<p>The definition of &#8220;work&#8221; in this context can be important to consider, as we can find ways to balance a tradeoff between compile times and the amount of object code generated for each instantiation. One technique to reduce these costs is by normalizing a given list of template arguments into something called a <em>canonical form</em>.</p>\n<h3 id="canonicalforms">Canonical Forms</h3>\n<p>A canonical form, resulting from a process called canonicalization, is a mathematical structure that is intended to reduce multiple different-looking but identical objects into <em>one</em> form that we can then manipulate as we see fit. Using an automatic code formatter is an example of transforming input (in this case, source code) into a canonical form.</p>\n<h3 id="applicationtotemplates">Application to templates</h3>\n<p>Consider a template like this one:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">template Expensive(Args...)\n{\n  /* Some kind of expensive metaprogramming or code generation */\n}</pre>\n<p>If we can think of a useful canonical form that isn&#8217;t too hard to compute, we can then write a second template <code>Reduce</code> to implement it, then inject it like in the following example.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">template Expensive(Args...)\n{\n  // Reduce to some kind of canonical form\n  alias reduced = Reduce!(Args);\n\n  // Where ExpensiveImpl is the same as above but renamed\n  alias Expensive = ExpensiveImpl!(reduced);\n}</pre>\n<p>To be worth doing, <code>ExpensiveImpl</code> must be <em>significantly</em> more expensive than the reduction operation (pay attention to differences in <code>sys</code> time when measuring this), where &#8220;significant&#8221; is meant statistically rather than informally, i.e., any win is good as long as you can rigorously prove it&#8217;s real.</p>\n<h3 id="anexample:sortingtemplatearguments">An example: sorting template arguments</h3>\n<p>Take a templated aggregate like this:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">struct ExposeMethods(Types...)\n{\n  /* Some kind of internal state dependant on Types but not their order */\n\n  static foreach(Type; Types) {\n    bool test(Type x) { \n      /* Something slow to compile depending on Type */\n    }\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>If it&#8217;s instantiated with, e.g., five different types across a large codebase, we could spend a lot of time redoing semantically identical compilation. If all possible types are used as input many times, we could end up with a few permutations, and if not we will probably get a few identical subsets.</p>\n<p>A canonical form that might come to mind (i.e., a potential definition of <code>Reduce</code>) is simply sorting the arguments by their names. This can be achieved <a href="https://dlang.org/library/std/meta/static_sort.html">via the use of <code>staticSort</code></a>.</p>\n<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>D has powerful metaprogramming and code generation features. But like anything in programming, their use isn&#8217;t free. If you want to avoid the situation where you find yourself making coffee while your project builds, then it&#8217;s imperative to be aware of the cost vs. benefits of the metaprogramming features you use. Then you can make intelligent decisions about your compile-time interfaces and implementations.</p>\n<h2 id="appendix-tracingthedcompilertocounttemplateinstantiations">Appendix &#8211; Tracing the D compiler to count template instantiations</h2>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a simple lesson in Linux userspace tracing: you can use a tool like <code>bpftrace</code> or <code>DTrace</code> to spy on the D compiler compiling other things, so we can get basic figures about the compilation of other D programs without either hacking the compiler or changing their build process.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need a <code>bpftrace</code> file like the following (saved as e.g., <code>main.bt</code>):</p>\n<pre>BEGIN\n{\n  printf("Tracing a D file\\n");\n}\nuprobe:/home/mhh/dlang/dmd-2.097.0/linux/bin64/dmd:_Dmain\n{\n  printf("This is the main\\n");\n}\nuprobe:/home/mhh/dlang/dmd-2.097.0/linux/bin64/dmd:_D3dmd10dsymbolsem24templateInstanceSemanticFCQBs9dtemplate16TemplateInstancePSQCz6dscope5ScopePSQDr4root5array__T5ArrayTCQEq10expression10ExpressionZQBkZv\n{\n  //We do nothing with the knowledge here but if you write some code you can get info about the templates relatively easily\n  printf("Instantiating a template\\n");\n}</pre>\n<p>What am I hooking here? That big mangled name in the middle of the script is <code>templateInstanceSemantic</code> in the <code>dsymbolsem</code> module in the DMD source. By hooking it, we can get a rough idea of when a template is being worked on.</p>\n<p>Running it with <code>sudo bpftrace main.bt</code> (eBPF tracing currently requires root) when building DMD, for example, I see there are about 50,800 template hits.</p>\n<p>You can use a more complicated script in a system like <code>bcc</code> to reconstruct the compiler&#8217;s internal data structures. With that, we can get output a bit more like <code>09:05:17 69310 b\'/home/mhh/d_dev/dmd/src/dmd/errors.d:85\'</code> and actually reconstruct the source/line info (alongside a timestamp and PID).</p>'}]}

It&#8217;s a full-term course with lectures, practical lessons, and exams, although it&#8217;s all remote now. This is the story about how I got there, the challenges I encountered, and how students sometimes surpass their teachers.</p>\n<h2 id="whatsindforuniversitystudents">What&#8217;s in D for university students</h2>\n<p>The job market for D is very small. As I always say during the first lesson, it&#8217;s unlikely that students are going to write D code for a salary, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that learning D is useless. Firstly, it&#8217;s much easier to learn how to program with D than with C or C++. This is important because many students don&#8217;t know how to program even after a full C/C++ course. Secondly, a broader outlook makes for better code. My familiarity with D improved my C++ skills and made it much easier to learn Python, especially its iterators. Most importantly, D is the future&mdash;of C++ and beyond. Many C++11/17/20 novelties were first battle-tested in D, and even today D is a much more modern and feature-rich language than C++.</p>\n<h2 id="whoamiandwhatsindforme">Who am I and what&#8217;s in D for me</h2>\n<p>For simplicity, I would say that I am a C++ programmer. This is my main line of work. Before this course, I&#8217;d never been a teacher of any sort. Even on my job, I&#8217;m not involved much in mentoring. After earning my master&#8217;s degree in Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics at UNN (Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod) in 2014, I had no relation to academics at all.</p>\n<p>In my first months of university, I entertained the thought of being a school teacher. Now I realize that this was just a call for justice of sorts. There is a stark difference between a high school and a university, and for me, the latter was a much better experience. It felt like in just one month at university I learned more than in one term in high school, and that was so cool. <em>Why couldn&#8217;t they explain it <strong>this way</strong> back in high school</em>, was my common thought. If only educators applied the same educational methods in a regular school, it would make the experience much better. My desire to become a teacher vanished the second I received my first paycheck as a programmer (in Russia, &#8216;programmer&#8217; is a very well-paid job and &#8216;school teacher&#8217; is the total opposite), but some memory of that desire remained.</p>\n<p>This was also the time when I became interested in D. Compared to C++ it looked like a perfect programming language. You can write code that would be as fast, but without all those C atavisms. I used D for my master&#8217;s thesis, and I loved it. My program was twice as small and simple as the older C++ version while performing better. Implementing complex and more efficient algorithms in D was much easier; doing the same in C++ would be too much work, and, like any student, I always struggled with my deadlines.</p>\n<p>Since then I&#8217;ve followed D and used it for my little pet projects. I&#8217;ve always wanted to help the D community in some way, but I couldn&#8217;t write any useful library, nor could I find the motivation for contributing to open source.</p>\n<h2 id="beginnings">Beginnings</h2>\n<p>In 2018, an unusual offer surfaced on the D mailing list: does anyone by any chance want to teach students in Moscow, Russia?</p>\n<p>The initiator was Dmitry Olshansky, a well-known member of the D community, the creator of <code>std.regex</code> and more. I contacted him and said I was interested. I didn&#8217;t see myself as a full-fledged lecturer and expected to be just an assistant. At the beginning that was the plan, with someone else acting as a lecturer. He was going to give lectures remotely via Skype, and I would assist him on site.</p>\n<p>To my surprise, the university in question was RSUH, Russian State University for the <em>Humanities</em>. As it turned out, they do have technical faculty there, and the students do actually code. I checked their program: D was introduced for third-term students, and during the first two terms they learned C, C++, Prolog, and even some Lisp, I think (a bit too much, but why not). Their math course was solid, too (yes, I am among those who think that math is important for programmers).</p>\n<h2 id="preparations">Preparations</h2>\n<p>I was introduced to the department staff. They explained everyone&#8217;s responsibilities and even offered the opportunity to join in scientific work as a programmer. We started working on the course program, although I barely included myself in that “we”. That was a mistake. With one month left until the classes started, the lecturer was suddenly leaving us. The news took me by surprise, but&#8230; there was still plenty of time, right?</p>\n<p>This was happening when it was time for me to complete all the formalities and start work. Though I knew they were hiring only me, for some reason I was still under the impression that I wouldn&#8217;t be alone. I can&#8217;t say why I thought so. Everything was saying that there would be no help and that I had to do the whole course by myself, but my impression was hard to shake. The grave realization only came one week before Day One. Only then did I start to prepare for real.</p>\n<h2 id="bureaucracy">Bureaucracy</h2>\n<p>This is supposed to be the part about the trials and tribulations of the endless bureaucracy awaiting a poor programmer&#8217;s soul. The amount of paperwork required to sign the contract was indeed an entertaining story to tell to my peers. And everyone was, as they say, “rolling on the floor laughing” when I described applying for a Mir payroll card (Mir is the Russian national payment system mandated in the state-funded sector). But that&#8217;s it, actually.</p>\n<p>The next bureaucratic task was composing the formal program, an official paper including the course program and the materials. There were indeed a lot of formalities there, but I got some help: they showed me the paper for a very similar course. At the end of the day, it was easier than I expected. For this, I should thank the university staff. It was a one-year contract. Renewing it every year only takes one piece of paper and a couple of pen strokes.</p>\n<h2 id="thefirstclass">The first class</h2>\n<p>The schedule was set up such that my first class happened to be a seminar (a.k.a. a practical lesson) instead of a lecture. This is only on paper, though with only one group consisting of just 14 people it didn&#8217;t make any difference. The schedule was adjusted later. I got two classes in a row and could decide which was a lecture and which was a seminar. I came up with the following arrangement: in the first class, I would lecture and answer general questions, and in the second, the students would program and ask practical questions.</p>\n<p>For the first lesson, I prepared a brief description of the language, a syntax overview, a compiler, and several problems to solve: calculating the area of a triangle, solving a quadratic equation, and similar problems that yield a simple output for simple input. The idea was to immerse students in the language and immediately give them something to do with it. The plan was a success. By the end of the class, most of the students had gotten the hang of using a command-line compiler, written some code in a text editor, and solved some problems.</p>\n<h2 id="notepadandthecommandline">Notepad and the command line</h2>\n<p>I bet many people would take issue with the command line and text editor part. Seriously? No IDE? IDEs for D exist, but I left it up to the students if they wanted to use them. The reason was my own experience in learning C++ and programming in general. Knowing how a compiler works and how to link several files into a project is integral to understanding the language as a whole.</p>\n<p>This is especially true for C and C++. Things like the difference between declaration and definition lose their meaning without understanding the build process. In D, such nuances are fewer. For example, header files are not required. Still, I meant to teach how to program in D, not how to use an IDE. Things like the principles of <code>import</code> are easier to grok when using a command-line compiler rather than some “intuitive interface”. And you learn the syntax faster if you write the code by hand without autocomplete doing it for you.</p>\n<h2 id="furtherdevelopment">Further development</h2>\n<p>Lifted by the success of the first seminar, I was slammed to the ground by the first lecture. It contained the full theoretical explanation of type systems and their various types, compared D with other languages, brought out the problems of C and C++, and demonstrated what makes D different. It was a total failure.</p>\n<p>I expected the lecture to take the whole 80-minute class, including questions, but it finished in less than an hour without a single question during or after the speech. I even asked if the students couldn&#8217;t hear or understand me, or if there was a problem with my diction. But the problem was with the lecture itself. First, it was too much for one class. Second, the lecture was based on the talks I did for my job that were intended for seasoned programmers. I realized that everything that I&#8217;d prepared for my future lectures must be tossed aside and rewritten from scratch.</p>\n<h2 id="thenewprogram">The new program</h2>\n<p>The first candidate for simplification, and by that I mean expunging, was metaprogramming. Getting rid of templates was impossible since even the most basic language features and algorithms are tied to them, but code generation of all sorts was the first to be removed. Following that was anything that required external libraries. What was left were things that D code can&#8217;t be written without.</p>\n<p>Since I had better success with live communication during actual programming, I decided to focus on that. Rewriting the course on the fly was tricky, but I came up with a solid plan: throughout the semester we would write a complex calculating program, during lectures we would study language features required for a given task, and then during seminars the ideas would be transformed into code.</p>\n<h2 id="thesemesterassignment">The semester assignment</h2>\n<p>If you’re a nerd like me, you’ve probably heard of <a href="https://youtu.be/-ruC5A9EzzE">the 10,958 problem</a>. The gist of it is that you need to put signs and parentheses between numbers composed of the digits 1 to 9 so that the result would be exactly 10,958. The solution exists for any number up to 11,000, except 10,958. There&#8217;s no proof that it doesn&#8217;t exist either, hence the 10,958 problem.</p>\n<p>I gave the students an assignment to write a program that would find the solution, brute-forcing any possible combination of signs and parenthesis. All calculations were done with <code>double</code> instead of some sort of <code>bignum</code>, so it&#8217;s not a real solution, but it&#8217;s simpler this way.</p>\n<p>I had several reasons to think that this was a well-fitting problem. First, I could write a solution I expected to see from the students in five hours or two evenings. Compensating for the students&#8217; level, it looked like a good project for a semester-long assignment. Second, the solution isn&#8217;t too straightforward. Simple brute force would take too much time so you need to cut off the equal variants in the beginning. And third, I was fascinated by this problem myself, so I thought the students would feel the same. I couldn&#8217;t be more wrong.</p>\n<p>Not only were a majority of students not into such mathematics, most of them couldn&#8217;t even grasp what the problem was about and what this 10,958 was for. I failed to get them interested.</p>\n<p>When I realized the problem, it was too late to change anything. So the first semester wasn&#8217;t very engaging. Only a few students could finish the assignment to its fullest. For the rest, it was impossible.</p>\n<h2 id="thesecondsemester">The second semester</h2>\n<p>Since it was a full-term course, I had time to make up for it. For the second semester, I tried to come up with something practical and interactive. I gave the students an assignment to write a game. They were learning networking, so it was to be a multiplayer game. I recalled playing “tic-tac-toe on an infinite field” with my peers during boring lectures. The smarter name for this game is Gomoku. Two players can play online, and the game logic is simple. I was hoping to spark students&#8217; interest. This assignment turned out much better than the previous one, but I still can&#8217;t call it a full success.</p>\n<p>I really wanted to show them how coroutines (fibers, as they are called in D) make async programming much more manageable, how nice <a href="https://vibed.org/">the vibe.d framework</a> is, and how easy it is to use external libraries with <a href="https://code.dlang.org/">the dub package manager</a>. Lesson One: don&#8217;t try to sell coroutines to those who don&#8217;t know what callback hell is. Lesson Two: always keep hardware limitations in mind.</p>\n<h2 id="problemsoutofnowhere">Problems out of nowhere</h2>\n<p>I would never have thought that single-threaded compilation could be thwarted by the memory limit. It happened because the computers at the university were equipped with only 2 GB of memory, and some students&#8217; netbooks worked on a mere 1 GB. Simple programs build just fine even on weak machines&mdash;D is much better than C++ in terms of compilation time&mdash;but a large framework like vibe.d requires a lot of memory for its compilation. Now imagine, I was just telling them how everything is so easy-peasy and then half the students couldn&#8217;t even compile a networked version of Hello World.</p>\n<p>In my defense, I checked everything in advance. I set up a virtual machine with 2 GB of memory and made sure that it worked with the special compiler flags. Theoretically, I was prepared. But dealing with a new library <em>and</em> a new build system <em>and</em> new compiler flags all at once was just too much for the students. Their brains were getting DoS’d and shut down. So even though I demonstrated how to compile a program on a low-memory machine, I still had to explain to them individually why the usual method of compilation wasn&#8217;t working. For those who had only 1 GB of memory, I didn&#8217;t even have a ready solution.</p>\n<p>But still, the results of the second semester were much better: absolutely everyone could write the client side of the game. Some had problems with coroutines on the server side, but in general, they got this part just fine. For me, that wasn&#8217;t enough. So I gave them a supertask: write a simple AI for the game. This would help them understand the advantages of the client-server architecture. They had to realize that an AI is just another client, so the server code should be left as it is, and on the client side, the only required modification was move polling. This was a good problem on architecture design, suitable for students who already had gotten a grip on programming.</p>\n<p>We also had a little contest. I invited the students to play some code golf, solving a simple problem with the smallest program possible. For encouragement, I promised to free the best-achieving students from writing a semester report. And if anyone could beat my solution, they would pass the semester examination automatically (in Russian universities, teachers are allowed to set arbitrary conditions, like participating in side projects, for passing the semester without the usual examination).</p>\n<p>As I expected, nobody could beat me, though a couple of students came up with some interesting tricks, like writing <code>10</code> instead of <code>"\\0"</code> to save two symbols. Some would say this is an abuse of the type system, but clever hacks like this speak to a student&#8217;s knowledge.</p>\n<h2 id="theresultsofthefirstyear">The results of the first year</h2>\n<p>I was asking too much for a single semester; only one student could write an AI that kind of worked (she said that the first time it made a sensible move, it made her really happy). Another student who complained the whole year that programming was not her thing and that she couldn&#8217;t understand anything managed to write her own client and server. At the end of the day, all was not for nothing.</p>\n<h2 id="thesecondtry">The second try</h2>\n<p>Everything described until this point happened during the 2018/2019 academic year. The higher-ups had no issues with the course, and I was able to continue on the following year. New students, new possibilities, a new program. This time I was much better prepared. I had materials for most of the lectures, no more need to redo everything on the fly, and during the summer I had time to fix the problems with the course.</p>\n<p>The 10,958 problem was expelled on the charge of being boring. Instead, the Gomoku game was expanded, now lasting <em>almost</em> the whole term. &#8220;Almost&#8221; because the first assignment was a problem regarding OOP: students had to implement various geometrical shapes as classes and draw them on screen with some customization. I made this the first step after Hello World so everyone could learn how to use the tools, and so I could judge their level.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not surprising that students are very different. Some are already working as programmers and attend the course out of curiosity, while some still struggle with variables and loops. From the beginning, I decided that my course would be not just for everyone, but for those who are interested. However, disregarding the others would be wrong, so we needed assignments for different levels.</p>\n<p>To jump-start the network study, I set up a server with the reference implementation, and everyone could connect to it and play. Even telnet would do. Allotting more time for an assignment and providing better explanations served students well. Many could finish the supertask. We even had a little contest between AIs. A human could still beat them with ease, but it was still a big improvement over the previous year.</p>\n<h2 id="apleasantsurprise">A pleasant surprise</h2>\n<p>I had the same code golf contest again. And again, I promised to give a free pass to whoever could beat me. I&#8217;m sure you can see where this is going, but first I must explain the problem in detail. The task was to implement a function, <code>challenge</code>, defined as follows:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">import std;\n\n/**\n* Params:\n* s = Multiline string, each line containing positive integers separated by whitespace.\n* Returns: An array containing the sums of each line and the grand total as the last element.\n*/\nuint[] challenge(string s);\n\nunittest {\n    assert(challenge("0") == [0, 0]);\n    assert(challenge("1\\n1") == [1, 1, 2]);\n    assert(challenge("2\\n2\\n3") == [2, 2, 3, 7]);\n    assert(challenge("2\\n2 0 3\\n3 1 1 4") == [2, 5, 9, 16]);\n}</pre>\n<p>Only the symbols inside the function body count. Using any Phobos functionality is allowed, but no renamed imports.</p>\n<p>My solution from the previous year was pretty straightforward:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">auto r=s.split(\'\\n\').map!(a=&gt;a.split.map!(i=&gt;i.to!uint).sum); return r.array~r.sum; // 84 characters</pre>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t show them my solution, I just told them its character count. I was absolutely sure that, just like the previous year, nobody could beat it. Imagine my shock when I was outdone in a mere week:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">auto r=split(src,&quot;\\n&quot;).map!&quot;sum(map!(to!uint)(a.split))&quot;.array;return r~[sum(r)]; // 82 characters</pre>\n<p>Even with the unneeded brackets, this solution was better, thanks to the shortened <code>map</code> syntax: passing a lambda as a string in the first case and passing <code>to</code> directly in the second. The latter was just my oversight, but the former was a typical teacher&#8217;s mistake. You see, back when I first wrote my solution, it wasn&#8217;t possible to pass a string to <code>map</code> like that. I don&#8217;t remember well what the problem was, something about scopes. I missed that it was fixed at some point. That&#8217;s how in just one year you become an old geezer teacher who can&#8217;t keep up with the times.</p>\n<p>I stayed true to my word and granted a free pass to the resourceful student at the end of the semester. I was concerned that securing the pass in the middle of the semester would demotivate him to attend classes, but fortunately, I was wrong.</p>\n<h2 id="covid-19strikes">COVID-19 strikes</h2>\n<p>Of course, I can&#8217;t omit how the pandemic impacted the educational system. In the spring of 2020, all classes were moved online. There are some pros and cons to this.</p>\n<p>Giving lectures remotely turned out to be very convenient. You can mutually agree on a suitable time, and you don&#8217;t need to find a free lecture room. Another very good thing is that students can either ask questions vocally&mdash;as when they raise their hands offline&mdash;or write them in the chat so that the teacher can answer them when it&#8217;s most appropriate. I really think that this system works very well.</p>\n<p>Practical lessons are problematic though, especially with those students who aren&#8217;t involved enough. When they sit in a classroom they at least do something. Why show up at all if you&#8217;re not going to do anything? When it&#8217;s online, they just skip class. The chemistry of a group coding session with a teacher ready to help won&#8217;t kick in. I encouraged them to ask questions not only during class but at any time, hoping that this would allow me to assist them whenever they are coding. But this only worked for a couple of people.</p>\n<h2 id="lessonsofthesecondyear">Lessons of the second year</h2>\n<p>The second year was better than the first but still less than ideal. I saw no need to modify the course, but its presentation had to be addressed.</p>\n<p>We need to tear down this wall in communication. Mutual trust between the teacher and the student makes for a better educational process. It&#8217;s difficult to work with those who are wary of the teacher even when doing alright. I don&#8217;t yet know a robust solution; each case is tackled individually.</p>\n<p>Even those who are doing well need some control. I used to think that attendance scrutiny is for those students who don&#8217;t really want to learn, to intimidate them to show up. When I was a student, the best teachers never bothered about absentees. So I too was liberal with these things, even when half the group was missing. But everything has its limits. Bad students will skip classes anyway, but lazy B-graders could benefit from a little scolding.</p>\n<h2 id="fastforwardtothepresent">Fast forward to the present</h2>\n<p>I don&#8217;t have much to say about the last year-and-a-half. Teaching D is now part of my life. Due to the pandemic, we&#8217;ve had to move online completely. I couldn&#8217;t even meet my students face-to-face. Aside from what I said earlier about how this affects the educational process, this also disrupted one of the ideas I had.</p>\n<p>I need some way to track students&#8217; progress to be sure that they actually follow the course and don&#8217;t just show up for classes. The way I handled this during the previous two years worked for some students: if they had a problem, they asked questions during a lecture or a practical lesson. But some students just keep quiet when they have problems, so I need some means to identify them. I couldn&#8217;t do written tests for programming; that would be nonsense. So during the summer break, I came up with the idea of doing some small quizzes if COVID restrictions were to be lifted. These quizzes would affect the final grade, but not much, as the intention behind them was to help students who are having problems, not to be the final straw that breaks the camel&#8217;s back. Unfortunately, remote lessons made this nearly impossible.</p>\n<p>My students keep surprising me, coming up with newer and better solutions to the code golf puzzle. Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t have the exact code of the student who won in the third year (it appears that she deleted her Github account), but it was something like:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">auto r=s.split(\'\\n\').map!(a=&gt;a.split.to!(uint[]).sum); return r.array~r.sum; // 74 characters </pre>\n<p>Again, it was a feature I didn&#8217;t know about: <code>to</code> converts between arrays, too.</p>\n<p>I thought that this problem was done and that there was no room for further improvement. Oh, how wrong I was. This is what they&#8217;ve brought me this year:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">return(s.split(\'\\n\')~s).map!(a=&gt;a.split.to!(uint[]).sum).array; // 63 characters</pre>\n<p>This completely destroys my solution with all the improvements! Note that the trick is not in the syntax, but in the logic. This works by concatenating the split lines with the original string, making it unnecessary to declare an intermediate array, which allows implementing this function as a single statement. I would never have thought to do that! Algorithms win over micro-optimizations, even in code golf.</p>\n<p>The biggest change this year is a new, formalized evaluation system. In the semester, students earn points for doing assignments and writing reports on them. The first and simplest assignment is worth 5 points, and the last and hardest is worth 30. The maximum number of points a student can score without participating in code golf is 100. Code golf is scored by the formula <code>110 − length</code>. The code golf winner this year got 47 points for his solution which earned him an exemption from writing any reports. We have a table listing every student&#8217;s points so everybody knows how many points they need to score. Everything is very transparent, so I don&#8217;t need to worry about not being objective when evaluating students.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://dlang.org/blog/2022/02/19/how-i-taught-the-d-programming-language-at-a-russian-university/feed/', 'slash_comments': '3'}

A PDF of an early report with the title &lsquo;Single-Block Navier-Stokes Integrator&rsquo; <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA240385">can be found here</a>. It describes the simple finite-volume formulation of the code that allows simulation of a nonreacting gas on a single, structured grid. Thirty years on, many capabilities have been added through the efforts of a number of academic staff and students. These capabilities include high-temperature thermochemical effects with reacting gases and distributed-memory parallel simulations on cluster computers. The language in which the program was written changed from C to C++, with connections to Tcl, Python and Lua.</p>\n<p>The motivation for using C++ in combination with the scripting languages was to allow many code variations and user programmability so that we could tackle any number of initially unimagined gas-dynamic processes as new PhD students arrived to do their studies. By 2010, the Eilmer3 code (as it was called by then) was sitting at about 100k lines of code and was growing. We were, and still are, mechanical engineers and students of gas-dynamics first and programmers second. C++ was a lot of trouble for us. Over the next 4 years, C++ became even more trouble for us as the Eilmer3 code grew to about 250k lines of code and many PhD students used it to do all manner of simulations for their thesis studies.</p>\n<p>Also in 2010, a couple of us (<a href="https://gdtk.uqcloud.net/docs/introduction/dev-team-and-contributors/">PAJ and RJG</a>) living in different parts of the world (Queensland, Australia and Virginia, USA) came across the D programming language and took note of Andrei Alexandrescu’s promise of stability into the future. Here was the promise of a C++ replacement that we could use to rebuild our code and remain somewhat sane. We each bought <a href="https://wiki.dlang.org/Books">a copy of Andrei’s book</a> and experimented with the D language to see if it really was the <em>C++-done-right</em> that we wished for. One of us still has the copy of the initial printing of Andrei’s book without his name on the front cover.</p>\n<h3 id="rebuilding-in-d">Rebuilding in D</h3>\n<p>In 2014 we got serious about using D for the next iteration of Eilmer and started porting the core gas dynamics code from C++ to D. Over the next four years, in between university teaching activities, we reimplemented much of the Eilmer3 C++ code in D and extended it. We think that this was done to good effect. <a href="https://www.scientific.net/AMM.846.54">This conference paper</a>, from late 2015, documents our effort at the initial port of the structured grid solver. (<a href="https://gdtk.uqcloud.net/pdfs/T0316-eilmer-dlang-v2.pdf">A preprint is hosted on our site</a>.) The Eilmer4 program is as fast as the earlier C++ program but is far more versatile while being implemented in fewer lines of code. It now works with unstructured as well as structured grids and has a new flexible boundary condition model, a high-temperature thermochemistry module, and in the past two years we have added the Newton-Krylov-accelerated steady-state solver that was used to do the simulation shown above. And importantly for us, with the code now being in D, we now have have many fewer <em>WTF</em> moments.</p>\n<p>If you want more details on our development of the Eilmer4 code in D, we have the <a href="https://gdtk.uqcloud.net/docs/pub-n-pres/presentations/">slides from a number of presentations</a> given to the <a href="https://mechmining.uq.edu.au/research/hypersonics">Centre for Hypersonics</a> over the past six years.</p>\n<h3 id="features-of-d-that-have-been-of-benefit-to-us-include">Features of D that have been of benefit to us include:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Template programming that other Mechanical Engineers can understand (thanks Walter!). Many of our numerical routines are defined to work with <code>numbers</code> that we define as an alias to either <code>double</code> or <code>Complex!double</code> values. This has been important to us because we can use the same basic update code and get the sensitivity coefficients via finite differences in the complex direction. We think this saved us a large number of lines of code.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>String mixins have replaced our use of the M4 preprocessor to generate C++ code in Eilmer3. We still have to do a bit of head-scratching while building the code with mixins, but we have retained most of our hair—something that we did not expect to do if we continued to work with C++.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Good error messages from the compiler. We often used to be overwhelmed by the C++ template error messages that could run to hundreds of lines. The D compilers have been much nicer to us and we have found the “did you mean” suggestions to be quite useful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A comprehensive standard library in combination with language features such as delegates and closures that allow us to write less code and instead concentrate on our gas dynamics calculations. I think that having to use C++ Functors was about the tipping point in our 25-year adventure with C++.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ranges and the foreach loops make our D code so much tidier than our equivalent C++ code.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Low-barrier shared-memory parallelism. We do many of the flow update calculations in parallel over blocks of cells and we like to take advantage of the many cores that are available on a typical workstation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Simple and direct linkage to C libraries. We make extensive use of Lua for our configuration and do large simulations by using many processors in parallel via the OpenMPI library.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The garbage collector is wonderful, even if other people complain about it. It makes life simpler for us. For the input and output, we take the comfortable path of letting the compiler manage the memory and then tell the garbage collector to tidy up after us. Of course, we don’t want to overuse it. <span class="citation">@nogc</span> is used in the core of the code to force us not to generate garbage. We allocate much of our data storage at the start of a simulation and then pass references to parts of it into the core functions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fast compilation and good optimizing compilers. Nearly an hour’s build time was fairly common for our old C++ code, and now we would expect a DMD or LDC debug build in about a quarter of a minute. This builds a basic version of the main simulation code on a Lenovo ThinkPad with Core i7 processor. An optimized build can take a little over a minute but the benefit of the faster simulation is paid back by orders of magnitude when a simulation job is run for several hours over hundreds of processors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>version(xxxx) { ... }</code> has been a good way to have variants of the code. Some use complex numbers and others are just double numbers. Also, some variants of the code can have multiple chemical species and/or just work with a single-species nonreacting gas. This reduction in physical modelling allows us to reduce the memory required by the simulation. For big simulations of 3D flows, the required memory can be on the order of hundreds of gigabytes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>debug { ... }</code> gets used to hide IO code in <code>@nogc</code> functions. If a simulation fails, our first action is often to run the debug-flavor of the code to get more information and then, if needed, run the debug flavor of the code under the control of <code>gdb</code> to dig into the details.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have a very specialized application and so don’t make use of much of the software ecosystem that has built up around the D language. For a build tool, we use <code>make</code> and for an IDE, we use emacs. The D major mode is very convenient.</p>\n<p>There are lots of other features that just work together to make our programming lives a bit better. We are six years in on our adventure with the D programming language and we are still liking it.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://dlang.org/blog/2022/02/02/a-gas-dynamics-toolkit-in-d/feed/', 'slash_comments': '5'}

What got on my mind was the even-further ingrained into my head idea that the more I slow down and not try to overdo things, the better my results are. Now, this is a battle I constantly have to have with myself, but, it&#8217;s one that I probably <strong>need</strong> to keep having. But, try explaining that to my subconscious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, a few weeks back now, I was cranking out the 110 ranks I needed to complete the Season/Expansion/wtf-ever Pass in Destiny 2. With the final ten ranks requiring five-times the experience per-level needed to get a level from 1-100, I was trying everything I could. I ground out missions, strikes, Solo Ops, anything that would knock out these Seasonal Challenges to get me further along the pass. I did so many that I ran out of Challenges to complete that didn&#8217;t involve getting a pick-up group to run Dungeons or Raids, which meant&#8230;Crucible. PvP, player versus player. The bane of my existence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a couple of Challenges I was zeroing in on, Scout Rifle and Solar kills particularly. So, I opted to do both at once, enter Polaris Lance, a Solar Scout that needs you hit your shots consistently to get use out of it. And do you, dear listener, know what I did? I hung back, I hit those shots, and I won more games than I lost in that run. I finished the Pass with two days to spare, got my cosmetics, and got the hell out of dodge. &#8220;Ash &amp; Iron&#8221; is trash, thus, I haven&#8217;t played since it dropped, and I haven&#8217;t bought the pass. But, passes kind of sort of don&#8217;t expire now, so my mad rush to finish them isn&#8217;t necessary any longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>But to go back to me in the Crucible, I played against every impulse I had to run ahead, to feed kills and Super energy to my opponents, and because of that, when my teams lost, it was close in every game but one. I hung back, I stayed glued to my teammates, I didn&#8217;t make any unreasonable, risky pushes to take Zones or chase down a kill. Which, is something I should be doing in general, with everything I do. Push when I know that I can get away with it, rather than push because it&#8217;s a day ending in -Y.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had games where <strong>I </strong>topped the scoreboard for my team, me, who can&#8217;t keep a K/D/R over 0.7 the majority of the time in whatever competitive game I play. I wasn&#8217;t trying to swipe kills from my team, I was hanging back to make sure I landed my shots, and didn&#8217;t feed the other team. Sure, I didn&#8217;t get the number of kills I&#8217;d have liked, but the assists still stacked up, I grabbed kills where I could, and wound up knocking out a couple more PvP challenges than I&#8217;d anticipated to, in far less time than I&#8217;d thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where I would normally run in with an auto or SMG, instead, I was hanging back, making sure I stayed with at least one teammate instead of going solo, and using the cover in each area. If I saw an enemy, I didn&#8217;t immediately engage without an exit plan, I played like I was on a team, instead of being an island unto myself. Doing that let me win duels, being one bullet ahead instead of a bullet behind, it even let me come out of a couple 2v1 fights alive where normally I&#8217;d get swallowed whole. Even being down a player, and going 6v5 didn&#8217;t rattle me like I normally would get, because I stuck to the plan I made for myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>See, I typically get incredibly stressed out in PvP, which leads to me feeding the other team, and occupying a permanent place at the bottom of a leaderboard. I tense up when I encounter an enemy, get shaky, and nervous about every duel I wind up in. What I did was bite down on my tongue each time I started to get that nervous feeling and shaky when I got into a fight. It isn&#8217;t a &#8220;healthy&#8221; response, but, it did keep my mind from spiraling as I played each match. That, and putting something on to mindlessly listen to while I played didn&#8217;t hurt either, I could zone out and just focus on what was in front of me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of that kept me from overthinking, over analyzing, just twisting myself into knots to the point where I couldn&#8217;t be effective. Which is what normally happens when I get myself stressed out, I become so shaky and nervous that I make every mistake in the book trying to hold together. When I&#8217;d died, between respawns I&#8217;d make myself take a deep breath, recenter myself, and try to get back to a teammate when I got back in. Doing that, I could get the jump on the enemy, instead of getting double-teamed myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing my rank go up in PvP, seeing my name not at the bottom of the board, it was pretty cool. It&#8217;s not something I&#8217;m going to do <strong>often</strong>, but to finish out a Pass, I&#8217;ll go slam my head on a wall for a bit. As long as I don&#8217;t play outright stupidly, I can hold serve long enough to get where I need to be, get my time in the mines over with as quickly as I can. As long as I can keep a hold of myself, not let myself get too overwhelmed by the task, I know I&#8217;m decent enough to not feel like I&#8217;m getting lapped by every player, just most of them.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2025/09/21/9-21-2025-play-smarter-not-harder/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img_2033.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img_2033.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99083f60d4aa0ceb8978c6efdb6625af912223a3ad80b500733b98ec5cef0e?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

I know it&#8217;s not &#8220;good&#8221;, but damnit I built this thing and I&#8217;ll make it good later!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahem. So, I&#8217;ve been playing a lot of No Man&#8217;s Sky since the Voyager update, where you can now build your own &#8220;Corvette&#8221; class ship to fly around in, and walk around in like it&#8217;s your own portable base. Last night, I finally worked up the money to buy all the parts I need to make me a Corvette, because I don&#8217;t know how the Expedition system works, and I&#8217;ve been too sick to give a damn about how to go about it and get a free Corvette (seriously, I feel like crap. Send help. Or more DayQuil and NyQuil.). Mine&#8230;is not great. It has the bare minimum of what you need to make it flight-worthy, and it shows. It&#8217;s a clunky, ugly mess that will get me from Points A to B, and not much else. But, it&#8217;s <strong>mine</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have hauled junked ships to Stations to scrap them, I have scrambled for my life from Sentinels as the game turns into Ace Combat 04 in space, all in the name of building my own ship. And I finally got it done around 11pm last night, flew it into a planet, and am seeing the good and the bad of it. The good, I have what amounts to a Pelican from Halo. The bad, the landing gear makes it ugly as sin, and I have this thing super vulnerable with the reactor being a massive target. It&#8217;s also very cramped inside, just enough room to jump out of the flight seat, and run around the hold while I&#8217;m on autopilot. When the Sentinels came on the planet I hit, I closed the hatch and looked out the cockpit. &#8220;At least I&#8217;m safe inside my mind&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like making something is a point of pride for me. It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s in a game, or real life, that stuff is fulfilling to me. I still have two windows in my house to fix before winter, and if I ever get off my back to do it, I&#8217;ll be super satisfied with my work. Will it be &#8220;pretty&#8221;? No, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be. It just has to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, I can always reconfigure the Corvette later once I have access to better components. I just wanted to get one of my own built while the drive to play the game is still there. I have some things to trick it out with, but, not as many as I&#8217;d like, nor the experience with the system to really experiment with it. It makes me happy, and that&#8217;s really all I can ask for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I ordered takeout tonight, and while it&#8217;s good, it just doesn&#8217;t have the same impact for me as the meals I cooked over the weekend did. My family still isn&#8217;t feeling great, and it was 4pm before the thought of making dinner finally sprang forty because work was busy. I don&#8217;t exactly feel proud of spending $30 on takeout, when if I <strong>really </strong>wanted to, I could have come up with something myself. It just &#8220;is&#8221; rather than is a dish that I can hang my hat on and say &#8220;yeah, <strong>I </strong>made that. I don&#8217;t care if you didn&#8217;t like it, I&#8217;m proud of myself for making it.&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>When I pick up the game again, I&#8217;ll still be going towards the center of the galaxy, but, I also want to keep amassing parts to make my ship my own. Sure, I have a Freighter, I have a (tiny) base, and I have my starting ship, but I want to make my stuff truly my own. Like with my little Corvette-class. It&#8217;s Spartan right now, but, I can make it fancy if I want to. I can make it to my very own liking if it so suits me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s the point of it, though, that makes it &#8220;worth it&#8221; to me. That I took these disparate pieces and smashed something together that sure, someone else <strong>could </strong>have done for me, but, was more intrinsically valuable to me by doing it myself. I have projects in real life that yes, I need to hire someone to do, and that&#8217;s fine. But the ones that I can fix myself? Those are the ones that mean the most to me overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could have done the legwork to do the Expedition and get a &#8220;free&#8221; Corvette ship, but, that&#8217;s not as satisfying to me. When the handyman gets up here to fix a leaky toilet, it&#8217;s not necessarily the most satisfying fix, but, only because it&#8217;s a battle I don&#8217;t have the time or the know how to <strong>keep </strong>fixed. Fixing my windows? I can swing that. I don&#8217;t need specialized tools, I just have to do it. Same with building up Relics, or bases, or ships. I just have to do it.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2025/09/15/9-15-2025-it-sucks-but-its-mine/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/static-assets-upload9467594363923905941.png'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/static-assets-upload9467594363923905941.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99083f60d4aa0ceb8978c6efdb6625af912223a3ad80b500733b98ec5cef0e?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

It&#8217;s kind of a farewell to the season, a way to celebrate one last time before &#8220;real life&#8221; starts back up in earnest. And with it being literally at the end of August this year, the end of the Blaugust event, it has me wistful and wishing the summer never ended. Kind of like how I felt as a kid, when the fireworks felt like summer ended, even though I&#8217;d been back at a school for a week or two at that point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mowed my yard for what will probably be the last time this year, and while it was easier than it had been all season, it felt sad to do, because it&#8217;s the tail end of doing it until the spring. I can feel the days getting shorter, the weather has been cooler than before, and in my mind, it feels like time slipping away. It hasn&#8217;t, I&#8217;ve been plenty busy this summer, I&#8217;ve done plenty of things, made changes I needed to make, it&#8217;s not like I haven&#8217;t done anything.

I don&#8217;t like the heat, I don&#8217;t like that my beleaguered baseball team is absolute dog water every year, the things I can&#8217;t control.

Especially when it&#8217;s hitting zero on the thermometer, and I&#8217;m freezing to death even with the heaters roaring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Summer is freedom to me, even though I&#8217;ve been &#8220;free&#8221; for years now, with the exception of my job. It&#8217;s meant that I can spend that time doing what I want to do, going where I want to go, even though I can just <strong>do </strong>that whenever now. It&#8217;s meant that I don&#8217;t have to coop up in this house, that I can grab the car keys and go somewhere like I did yesterday. It&#8217;s probably a holdover from my childhood, but, what isn&#8217;t at this point?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8230;I should really just use my PTO and realize that there&#8217;s three other seasons, and that just because it&#8217;s colder/freezing/not as warm, that I can just go do things without waiting for the calendar to say June/July/August. Just because summer is ending, it doesn&#8217;t mean that I can&#8217;t just take some time and go do something that interests me. It isn&#8217;t like I can&#8217;t just jump into the car at 5pm on a cold January evening and drive around for an hour because it &#8220;isn&#8217;t the right months&#8221;. Or take a trip to the city and go shopping for something I&#8217;ve wanted and don&#8217;t want to order online. I don&#8217;t <strong>have </strong>to be responsible <strong>all the time</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Because in my mind, those other seasons? Those are when I have to be &#8220;responsible&#8221;, have to be buttoned up and an adult, while in the summer, I can screw around and get weird with it. Which hasn&#8217;t been the case for a long time, since my &#8220;responsible&#8221; time is &#8220;between the hours of 7am-4pm, Monday-Friday&#8221;, and all through the year. After that, I can be a screwball weirdo all I want, as long as I&#8217;m not hurting anyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with Blaugust, it feels like it&#8217;s my chance to get really experimental with how I write, even though there&#8217;s no rule book <strong>to</strong> writing like this. I can get weird all year! Why am I stocking up my stream-of-consciousness yapping to burn on one month, instead of just doing weird shit whenever I want? It&#8217;s not like the Blog Gods are going to come down and smite me for writing about baseball in January!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That freedom to go off the map is there all year, and I need to learn how to just run with it. That &#8220;summer vacation&#8221; for me is just a state of mind, not a reality I have to live with any longer. That fireworks show tonight will be the &#8220;unofficial&#8221; end of summer, but that summer doesn&#8217;t have to end for me. I can make it last forever in my mind if I want to, I don&#8217;t have to let that freedom go just because the calendar and the leaves change.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2025/08/31/blaugust2025-day-31-end-of-the-line/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/img_1751-1.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/img_1751-1.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99083f60d4aa0ceb8978c6efdb6625af912223a3ad80b500733b98ec5cef0e?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

A rematch from the semifinals in last year&#8217;s Playoff, the marquee game of the opening weekend, yadda, yadda, yadda. I didn&#8217;t watch it. Not because I don&#8217;t care about my Buckeyes, but, because I knew that I could not handle the stress of it. I know how I am, and you could door me up on happy pills until the cows came home, they would not touch that kind of anxiety that comes from this team that I put way too much of my mental health into every autumn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We won, by the way. 14-7 against the preseason number one, made Arch Manning look lost, made <strong>two </strong>goal-line stands, and at least for one week, I stave off that stress-induced heart attack that <strong>will </strong>kill me one of these days. New starting Quarterback Julian Sayin did what he needed to, didn&#8217;t blow it, and the defense looked like a pack of killers from what I&#8217;ve gleaned post-game. Are we good enough to repeat as National Champions? Probably not, but I feel very lucky that I&#8217;ve gotten to see three Natties in my lifetime, and I&#8217;m still in that post-championship glow period. As long as we beat Michigan this year, I&#8217;ll take not winning a championship. I&#8217;ll take the gold pants over a gold trophy if I have to choose between the two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those not drowned in why I&#8217;ve seen be described as &#8220;midwestern Doom Opera&#8221;, Ohio State&#8217;s biggest rival is Michigan. Every year, they play in what is known simply as &#8220;The Game&#8221;. No trophy, no cute rivalry name, no. It is &#8220;The Game&#8221;, and Ohio State has lost the last four games in the series, after winning seven of them in a row. That game, plays havoc so badly on my nerves that I will do nearly <strong>anything </strong>to <strong>not</strong> watch it. I will clean my house, I will work overtime at my job, I will go drive to god-knows-where to get something, or just go where there is no cell service so that I won&#8217;t be able to check the score. Those aren&#8217;t examples I&#8217;ve pulled from thin air, either. I&#8217;ve done <strong>all </strong>of those things in the past to not watch The Game. This game against Texas? I was hitting that level of stress a month ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>So, what&#8217;d I do to mitigate it? I ran errands, I went and did things, I did as much as I possibly could to push this game out of my mind as long as I could stand it. I took my mom for coffee, I went to Lowe&#8217;s and bought paint, I went to the Amish bakery, I bought mums to plant, I drove to Walmart and hemmed and hawed about what pens I wanted to buy, I drove to another county blasting my music just because I could. I did all these things, and still the need to check that score crept in. So, when I got to a place to pull off, I did just that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fourth quarter, 3:28 to go, and Texas just scored. Shit, here it comes. My anxiety goes from a 3 on the scale of 1-10, to a 12. I throw on more music, I throw on a podcast, even my beloved Hangman Page&#8217;s theme, &#8220;Ghost Town Triumph&#8221; can&#8217;t dull the nerves for me. When I finally muster the nerve to check in again, I see it. &#8220;Ohio State 14, Texas 7, End of Game&#8221;. Oh my god. Oh my god! They&#8217;ve done it! I&#8217;m over the moon, all my stress fades away in an instant. I&#8217;m now 30 miles from home and at a stop sign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My drive home wasn&#8217;t nearly as nerve-wracking as my drive to where I wound up. Sure, it&#8217;s a holiday weekend, and there are cops crawling the highway, whatever, I&#8217;m driving exactly the speed limit. I turn off to a backroad that will get me most of the way to where I want to get off of the highway at to go home. I know this song and dance, I used this road many a time to dodge cops setting speed traps in those four years I spent driving this highway every day. I know where they camp at, I know <strong>when </strong>they camp. Me turning off and driving a lesser-used road that gets me to the same place a little slower than the highway is no big deal to me. Maybe the happy pill <strong>is </strong>working, because the two cops I saw in that town would have scared the life out of me a few years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>But, all that is a way for me to kind of realize that I don&#8217;t <strong>have </strong>to set myself into a pressure cooker every time there&#8217;s something that will stress me out. I get stressed over high-stakes football games, okay, I don&#8217;t <strong>have</strong> to watch them? I can watch them after the fact, or just skip it altogether if it&#8217;s a result I don&#8217;t like. If that tOSU/UTexas game comes on as a rerun sometime, hell <strong>yes</strong> I&#8217;ll watch it. Ohio State/Michigan from 2021-whenever we finally can beat them again? Nah. I can skip it. My coworker hasn&#8217;t given me <strong>too much </strong>crap about it the past few years, and my new boss is a Texas fan, so, I probably shouldn&#8217;t needle him about this game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Same with seeing those cops while I was driving. I think I can trust myself more than I used to, know that as long as I&#8217;m not doing anything wrong, they have no reason to pull me over. I&#8217;m driving the speed limit, I&#8217;m not driving erratically, I&#8217;m not on my phone, I&#8217;m doing what I&#8217;m supposed to, I shouldn&#8217;t need to panic. Maybe it&#8217;s the happy pills talking, but I drove past a speed check on my journey, and didn&#8217;t lose my mind immediately when I saw the cop. Okay, speed limit&#8217;s 45 and I&#8217;m going 44, we&#8217;re good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When that last Saturday of November comes up, I&#8217;ll probably do the same thing. Ideally, I won&#8217;t have to take a cat to the Vet that day, like in 2022, but, I can find things to occupy my mind the majority of it. I can make a long drive to somewhere if it means I don&#8217;t turn into a puddle of nerves at the sight of the colors Maize and Blue. I can throw my music on, listen to my podcasts, find diversions to take the stress and anxiety of this thing I can&#8217;t control off of me for long enough for it to go down, the dust to settle, and me to calm my nerves. I could drive someplace I&#8217;ve never been if the idea strikes me in that moment. It&#8217;d probably be more fun than staring at a tv for four hours in a full-blown panic attack.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2025/08/30/blaugust2025-day-30-dont-think-about-it/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_2012.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_2012.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99083f60d4aa0ceb8978c6efdb6625af912223a3ad80b500733b98ec5cef0e?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

I went to pay the mortgage and get pizza after work, sue me (don&#8217;t actually). It came to my mind when I went to pick up the pizza, and the guy who runs the place spoke to me, asked me how my dad was. I did all the usual pleasantries, &#8220;old and sleepy, haha&#8221; , but that isn&#8217;t my point. My point is that, man, 16-year-old me would <strong>hate </strong>34-year-old me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See, in a long-since former life, I, my dad, and to an extent my mom, all worked for the guy who supplied their arcade machines in the pizza place&#8217;s &#8220;game room&#8221;. That&#8217;s how he knows us, because he&#8217;d see us at least once a week to collect the machines and give him his cut of the money they made. Sometimes it&#8217;d be a ton, sometimes it&#8217;d be barely $50 total for the whole room, but, we didn&#8217;t screw him on his money, like our boss would. And with this being Labor Day Weekend, they&#8217;re going to be hopping all weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that got me and my mom to talking about how we&#8217;d have taken care of his business had we actually been the ones making decisions back then. That pizza place, and a couple other locations that would have been our &#8220;Crown Jewels&#8221;, AKA, &#8220;the ones who get the absolute <strong>best </strong>machines, most detailed support, consistently checking in to make sure we <strong>keep</strong> them as a client&#8221;. Then it hit me, that the younger me, who had to be given the &#8220;if you aren&#8217;t going to work, you aren&#8217;t going to get paid, now let&#8217;s just go&#8221; from my dad back then, he would never have been like that. He&#8217;d have done&#8230;about the same as that old boss, only without snorting all the profits to support a pain pill habit. How that man even made it to 60-ish I will <strong>never</strong> know.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Now, mid-30s me is kind of a workaholic, hell, I&#8217;m picking up a holiday shift and Saturday next week at work because I have nothing else going on. Teenage me most certainly was not like that. We only got paid a little bit more than gas money back then, so, that carrot on the stick was pretty small, and Final Fantasy XI was well into its heyday as well, so, I wanted to spend <strong>every</strong> waking moment in front of the Xbox 360 playing it. I didn&#8217;t want to work, or do chores, or run errands, or do yard work, no. I wanted to sit and play this game until my eyes bled, and then play some more. That isn&#8217;t a good way to start a career, even if it&#8217;s under-the-table because I was in high school.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t until mid-college that I actually started getting myself in gear to do class work, actually <strong>go </strong>to work and class, not be a lazy piece of crap at my best. Sure, my grades in high school were great, but I didn&#8217;t have to try. College, and the actual working world where I didn&#8217;t get to set my hours, that made me have to knuckle down, and drag myself across the line to get things done when I didn&#8217;t want to. That, eventually became just doing it when it came up instead of just putting in the bare minimum of effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, thinking about going to collect the machines from that pizza place, or the resort we had machines at, especially on a holiday weekend? 34-year-old me would have been hounding 16-year-old me as hard as my dad did back then. That&#8217;s the biggest clients we have, you can play games <strong>later</strong>, we take care of these guys, end of story. Grab your wallet, your shoes and let&#8217;s get going.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Me now would have had a gameplan for what clients we collect each day, what vending machines we did restocks on, and wedge in slack time to go do repairs for clients that needed an arcade cabinet fixed. We&#8217;d be cross-referencing clients&#8217; operating days and hours, and determine our route for the day based on that information. Go service locations A/B/C/D on Monday, D/E/F on Tuesday, G/H/I and penciling in replacing a coin chute on a location at C on Wednesday, and so on. My younger self would have thrown a fit at me, but, running a successful, sustainable business means you have to get up and do the work. I know how I was, a moody, snippy little prick, and me now has no time or patience for that nonsense. Me now has a schedule, a routine, and a laundry list of things that need done each day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That pizza shop? We&#8217;ve known the owners for 20+ years, I went to school with their daughter/granddaughter (the other owner is that guy&#8217;s father-in-law). We moved a pizza oven into a location they were setting up pro-bono (and I witnessed them arguing about the logistics of it in Spanish saying a lot of words my teacher at the time wouldn&#8217;t teach us), even now, years after that old boss and that shop broke things off, he asks how my dad is. Like, if he needed us for anything, we&#8217;d probably help out no questions asked. That isn&#8217;t something you develop without actually caring for the client, without actually getting up and going when they call with a problem. That&#8217;s where past and present me would have our biggest clash of heads. He both didn&#8217;t, nor did he want to try. I don&#8217;t necessarily <strong>want </strong>to have to try, but, it&#8217;s gotta be done, and no one else is coming, it <strong>has </strong>to be me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t have to work tomorrow, but, I&#8217;ve got things to keep me busy. I&#8217;m on the hook for going to buy mums tomorrow, which will distract me during the Ohio State/Texas game, it&#8217;s work, but it&#8217;s things that probably need to be handled now, when I have a minute, rather than later, when I don&#8217;t. That six-day week is going to crunch me for time next Saturday, so, I have plans for this one. We need paint for the living room, we&#8217;re going to get mums, and I have a yard to mow Sunday. My younger self would be dragging ass to get one of those things done, and while current me will be, it&#8217;ll be because he&#8217;s trying to get them all taken care of, instead of wanting to go inside and play games all day.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2025/08/29/blaugust2025-day-29-not-pleased-to-meet-me/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1996.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1996.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99083f60d4aa0ceb8978c6efdb6625af912223a3ad80b500733b98ec5cef0e?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

So, I&#8217;m going to sit here, play my silly little games, watch my silly little cartoons, and try not to think too hard before work tomorrow. I also forgot to take my happy pill this morning, so, the comedown from that has me a little erratic right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But like, I think I need a day occasionally where I don&#8217;t take my medicine, just to let myself feel all those emotions that the medicine represses, or I just repress because I&#8217;m a bundle of neuroses and unresolved traumatic incidents. Then the next day, I take my happy pill, and get right back into the saddle. It&#8217;s a nice balance, I think. A day where I throw double birds at my laptop screen all day and want to both cry and rip my own head off is a counterweight to not feeling much aside from &#8220;chill&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ripping off my own head was because of a case I &#8220;helped&#8221; on today, where the lowest priority support had an issue that I sniffed out in a few seconds. Then I became a teacher for five minutes trying to get this proverbial horse to drink after dragging it to the water. They&#8230;aren&#8217;t getting much better than this, are they? When even my Tier 3s are saying they have zero faith in this hiring class, it&#8217;s not been a fun time. God bless the three competent people down there playing Sisyphus&#8217; greatest hits every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, I seem to be sitting in the dark writing instead of turning on my lamp for the evening. The goal is to make some headway in Xenoverse 2 tonight, maybe throw in some No Man&#8217;s Sky with its new update if I get time to. Very glad that tomorrow is Friday, because the two days I have off will be it before I go into a six-day week next week, with 16 hours of overtime. Gotta love holiday pay. I&#8217;ll be scarfing down happy pills like candy next week.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2025/08/28/blaugust2025-day-28-feeling-it/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/img_1631.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/img_1631.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99083f60d4aa0ceb8978c6efdb6625af912223a3ad80b500733b98ec5cef0e?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

Like today, I had a call the day before where a client isn&#8217;t able to do a specific thing, I try to remote in, the user isn&#8217;t available and will call us back. Okay, I can live with that. The client calls back while I&#8217;m at lunch, so someone on my team gets the call. Dear reader, do you know what she did with that call? Nothing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Okay, so, what did you do while you had him on the phone?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Nothing, I&#8217;ve never seen it before so I don&#8217;t know how to fix it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You gotta be kidding me. Instead of remoting in, documenting the issue, you tell them I&#8217;ll call them back once I clock back in, and do nothing with it? Oh, they got their call, straight to their Voicemail. Still waiting on that call to be returned, by the way. If it comes in while I&#8217;m out for the evening, too bad. I&#8217;m off the clock, someone else can deal with it, it isn&#8217;t like I don&#8217;t take calls for their cases while they&#8217;re away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But like, it&#8217;s frustrating to see. I get irritated when I get calls from other departments where the transfer notes are just my department&#8217;s three-letter designation in our call software. But, I&#8217;ve battled many times with many people over crappy documentation, I&#8217;m used to it. When someone on my own team gets a call and gives us nothing to work with? I was halfway towards flying off the handle, happy pills or no.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>There are some days where I really wonder <strong>why </strong>my job keeps me around, but, there are <strong>also </strong>days like today, where it becomes readily apparent that I am in fact, far better than I give myself credit for. I&#8217;ve repeated it a million times by now, but my notes are thorough, my documentation is there, if I see a problem, and I can work it, I will show what I did. I will explain why I did it, and give a rundown of the case for the next person to see the case. If I send something to another department, I will tell you <strong>exactly </strong>why I sent it, what my reason is, and what I want you to do. If I close a case, or dispatch it out, you will know my reasoning for what I&#8217;d done, because you can&#8217;t read my mind, and I can&#8217;t read yours either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when I see my own people doing the same shit I light into other departments for? I see red. What do you mean you didn&#8217;t put any notes into the case, even just to say you took a call on it and reporting what the client says!? Or when a case calls in, I get the call and the only update is someone telling the client to call us? What the hell kind of Customer Service is that!?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have gone to my boss, and every boss I have had in nine years on this subject, and the post-Covid, &#8220;everyone is permanently work-from-home&#8221; years has only made it worse. Those of us who are working towards moving up, you can tell what our work looks like, detailed notes, documentation of what was done, what our next steps should be. My cracking jokes about having nightmares that I&#8217;m late for work and crashing my car in a parking garage are not indicative of the quality of my work when it&#8217;s time <strong>to </strong>work. No, when it&#8217;s time to go, we go. I know my stuff, and I prove it with my case updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>I know, not everyone works like me, but that isn&#8217;t even my point! My point is that we owe it to the client to give them our best shot whenever they call in, or get them to who can. When my own people won&#8217;t even remote in and do the bare minimum of troubleshooting on an issue, it <strong>really </strong>burns me up. Because then it seems like we aren&#8217;t even trying. Which makes us as a team, as a company, look bad to those clients paying us a <strong>lot </strong>of money for our products and support for those products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I took a call on this person&#8217;s case the day before, and resolved the issue in a few minutes. When I did, I noted down what I did, documented the steps I took to resolve the issue, and reiterated that in my closing notes. Not because I was trying to style on them, but because that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m <strong>supposed</strong> to do, and also to give them notes on how to fix that issue the next time they see it. Because that&#8217;s how I have my little note repository, I take those fixes, write them out, and save them! My notes go back nine years, and I&#8217;m <strong>still</strong> sorting through them to through into my OneNote book for work!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not asking for the world, I&#8217;m asking for basic competence from the people on my team. Some of us are more than pulling our weight, doing all those things that are expected to adequately take care of a client, while others are doing the bare minimum and only succeeding at frustrating us, and the customer. You take a call, work it as best you can, and note what you did! That&#8217;s all I ask! It should not be this much of an issue!</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2025/08/27/blaugust2025-day-27-show-your-work/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/img_1809.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/img_1809.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99083f60d4aa0ceb8978c6efdb6625af912223a3ad80b500733b98ec5cef0e?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

And surprisingly, it&#8217;s one I should have seen a million miles away, and he <strong>yammed </strong>it home with the concept.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, out of all the characters I&#8217;ve created for my little car-crash setting of the &#8220;Alterverse&#8221;, my personal little fanfiction-adjacent playground for ideas, Eoghanan is my personal favorite. He&#8217;s the ideal me in my mind, was a legitimate baseball prospect at Shortstop in high school, became an adventurer and knight, married his high school sweetheart, works as a teacher because he wants to help raise up the next generations, he&#8217;s everything I wanted to be growing up. He&#8217;s gone through a lot in his life, lost friends to violence, been taken captive, nearly lost the love of his life, but has pulled through to survive and help others. But what happens when you rip it all away? What happens when all those things that ground him, all those people who mold him into who he is, what happens when you tear them all away? That&#8217;s a question my brother asked, and hit a home run (to push the baseball metaphor harder) with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He asked the question, &#8220;what if Eoghanan was raised into Undeath as a Death Knight?&#8221;, which lead to a perfect title for him, &#8220;The Death Rider&#8221;. He came up with it because I told him once that the current starting point for nearly 40-year-old Eoghanan is &#8220;what if Jon Moxley (pro wrestler) had a sword?&#8221;. The dry humor, the beginning of gravel to his voice, kind of adopting &#8220;Wild Thing&#8221; as a personal anthem, the springboard I use for him is just Mox. Not leader of &#8220;The Death Riders&#8221; Mox, but closer to Blackpool Combat Club, loose-cannon badass Mox. As he put in his autobiography, sort of a John McClane from Die Hard type.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>He set the table for that incarnation based on the Fractures In Time from World of Warcraft, where versions of characters from other timelines intersect with the main one. He started with the idea of Highlord Marnes, or &#8220;Deathlord Frostbane had he never been killed at Lordaeron&#8221;, and branched from there. He got to The Death Rider, and my mind went off. I started getting ideas of how we got here, what caused him to become a Death Knight, and what that timeline looks like because of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So picture this, Legion, The Burning Shores. Designate Killjoy is called back in to counter the Burning Legion&#8217;s incursion on Azeroth. Our intrepid strike team ports in from Vana&#8217;Diel, not knowing The Horrors would await them. It doesn&#8217;t go well. Like in the main line, Highlord Tirion Fordring, King Varian, and Warchief Vol&#8217;Jin all fall on the shore. But it doesn&#8217;t end there. One by one, Killjoy is cut down by the Legion. Merrex, Rayder, Kate, Firewalker, Scarlet, Lance, and even Vera fall. Eoghanan is all that&#8217;s left. Blood pouring from his body, Scythe and Greatsword in hand, he steadies for his last hurrah, his last stand in a losing battle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Army Of Light takes the Shore, the combined might of the various factions of Azeroth, and the full weight of the Galactic Federation behind them are just <strong>barely </strong>enough to win the day. But the cost is high. Deaths are in the thousands, Killjoy isn&#8217;t special in this case, squad after squad is wiped out entirely, as the Deathlord walks through the now quiet battlefield to try and begin to tally the dead, a hand clings to his boot. A voice weakly calling to him amidst the carnage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Deathlord! I-I know you can hear me! They&#8217;re dead! All of them!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Malone?&#8221; He crouches down to comfort the shellshocked knight. &#8220;How badly are you injured? Speak to me, stay with me boy!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to make it. I can&#8217;t move, I can&#8217;t feel my legs.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A pall washes over his face, he knows that this is the end of the line. A quiet look of acceptance and resignation as he accepts his death, and maybe, just maybe getting to see Vera again. As he closes his eyes and tries to drift off, all he can see is the image of the Burning Legion ending her life, again, and again. He seems them cutting down his friends, all with the same deranged look of glee and satisfaction, not even in the name of Sargeras. His eyes open, acceptance and resignation turned into anger and a need for vengeance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Marnes. I&#8217;m not going to make it. Will you&#8230;will you raise me as a Death Knight?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Samuel, you know not what you ask for, you know that your soul will not rest, even should we defeat the Legion.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;&#8230;I don&#8217;t care. She&#8217;s gone, Deathlord. They killed her. They killed all of them. I&#8217;m not going to make it off this beach either&#8230;I&#8217;m bleeding out, I can&#8217;t move. So please, let me be of some use.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Deathlord raises one of his Blades of the Fallen Prince, &#8220;&#8230;it shall be done.&#8221; The blade pierces Eoghanan&#8217;s heart, ending his suffering, as a blue swirl of energy emanates from his body and the sword.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a (very) rough setup for how he gets from Point A to Point B, but the general bones are there. Legion, but Everything Goes Badly. Once he&#8217;s raised into Undeath by Bolvar Fordragon, he becomes the Deathlord&#8217;s right hand, carrying a Rune Forged incarnation of Balmung into battle, leaning into the Blood discipline. From there, he scours the Broken Isles, becoming a one-man army of vengeance toward the Legion. Gone are the jokes, gone is the light-hearted nature, gone is the need to hold back on those who wronged him. He becomes a terror in his own right, carving bloody swathes through the demonic hordes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When he crosses over to the main universe in Fractures, his counterparts are horrified at what he&#8217;s become. Meeting himself, main Eoghanan sees what he could have become had he lost those closest to him. Highlord Marnes is shocked at the level of violence that The Death Rider is willing to go to in order to battle back the Void. In his universe, the Legion took an immeasurable toll on all those who walked out the other side. Azeroth, and countless other planets bearing the scars of their war. Even main Frostbane is saddened that someone he&#8217;s seen grow as a soldier and as a man, would willingly set himself down this awful path in order to avenge those he&#8217;s lost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, this isn&#8217;t a final draft of that concept that my brother came up with. Not even close, but, it is something that I can mentally chew on, an idea that I can just go a little nuts with, because it doesn&#8217;t tie into my internal, overarching narrative. It doesn&#8217;t conflict with anything I consider &#8220;canon&#8221;, and can use it as a way to explore different themes and motivations for characters I thought I&#8217;d known for as long as I&#8217;ve been doing this. It&#8217;s a fun little narrative experiment that I can go on, and for once, I kind of have to hand it to my brother for jumping on a really fun concept.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2025/08/26/blaugust2025-day-26-lets-get-edgy/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_1520-1.png'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_1520-1.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99083f60d4aa0ceb8978c6efdb6625af912223a3ad80b500733b98ec5cef0e?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

I&#8217;m not great at it, seeing as I&#8217;m the slowest person in the room in terms of pure reaction speed, but, I&#8217;m kind of holding my own. I did manage to take the first actual boss down along with me in one run last night, so, technically I&#8217;ve beaten the first area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s an Early Access game that just hit its EA release in the past week (as of time of writing), so, it&#8217;s missing a lot of things. Weapons, levels, parts of its story, but having followed Ultrakill&#8217;s development like I have, it isn&#8217;t a huge deal. I can play what&#8217;s there, the rest when it&#8217;s added, and a full run once it&#8217;s all out. The way it plays reminds me of Ultrakill as well, with having to play aggressively to keep topped up on health, a grapple that you use to throw objects at targets, and me having to tap dance on my mouse and keyboard to keep up. I like it, even if it is physically demanding for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5197" height="576" src="https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1984.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, I only have two weapons, the pistol and assault rifle, but you can only take one with you on a run. To compensate for your lack of firearms, you get a sword, grenades that recharge after a few seconds, and the ability to gain abilities to shoot at enemies. While you&#8217;re on a run, you&#8217;ll gain upgrades to attach to yourself and your weapons, that you&#8217;ll keep for the duration of said run. What I found worked really well for me was using a chain-lightning ability, increased grenade range and damage, along with stacking 60+ percent recoil reduction on my rifle as I technically cleared the first area, albeit dying right as I killed the boss.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5201" height="576" src="https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1981.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>So, what&#8217;s the game about so far? You are Subject 1473, thrown onto a train and dumped off in an apartment-looking holding cell. Before you drop into your first run, you drop down to a secret area under your room, where the previous Subject 1473 brings you up to speed on why you&#8217;re here. He&#8217;s dead. He&#8217;s a disembodied voice telling you plug a chip into your head from a skeleton. It&#8217;s fine, don&#8217;t worry about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5198" height="576" src="https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1980.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You are&#8230;somewhere. Somewhere under the watchful eye of IDRIS, an AI overlord obsessed with &#8220;testing&#8221; his subjects. Sounds like GLaDOS, except IDRIS &#8220;tests&#8221; by making them fight through waves upon waves of machines. You aren&#8217;t the first, nor are you the last. The previous 1473 says you <strong>can</strong> escape, but only by fighting your way to freedom. May as well get started, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5199" height="576" src="https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1979.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Occasionally you&#8217;ll be shifted from the area you&#8217;re in, to what seems like an office complex, for a &#8220;Voidaxis Industries&#8221;, seems kind of specific, almost like they had a hand in&#8230;whatever this is. Logs will occasionally be found that talk about the beginning of whatever crisis this is, or notes from other, less fortunate test subjects. I found one who told that she was going to hole up under a rock, and left whoever found the note a upgrade item. I didn&#8217;t see her, so either she&#8217;s Hide And Seek Grand Champion, or she also fell to the same thing as the previous 1473.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5200" height="576" src="https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1982.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, what&#8217;s so interesting about it? Well, it&#8217;s not like every run is the same, you&#8217;ll have branching paths after certain islands in the area you&#8217;re in. You&#8217;ll fight, you&#8217;ll traverse, and occasionally be given the option of going one way towards say, an Item Chest, or a Corruption that you can take on to give yourself a better shot at better rewards, should you survive. Or you can see splits for say, an Obelisk that will give you something, in exchange for possibly damaging you or taking an upgrade away. Or you can get something as simple as a shop that lets you pick from a range of upgrades in exchange for Credits you&#8217;ll pick up from crates and enemies.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5202" height="576" src="https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1985.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also enhance your character with Decryptors to unlock upgrades on three separate trees, but you aren&#8217;t pigeonholed down one path at a time, or in any particular order. Then once unlocked, you can upgrade those upgrades with Voidium, a resource you pick up from chests and crates, that does persist between runs. I don&#8217;t have many upgrades unlocked, but the ones for increased health, and health back after completing an island are almost invaluable. The most recent runs I&#8217;ve played have gone down much, much smoother with more health, and being able to heal between fights.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5203" height="576" src="https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1986.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of, how <strong>do</strong> you heal? Well, you heal by staggering enemies, which you can do a couple different ways. First, you can stagger them with those grenades that charge back up after a few seconds, or, the even more fun way, by using the Gravity Tether. The Tether, lets you grab objects (or debris from the environments you can wreak havoc upon) and hurl them at enemies. If you get certain upgrades, you can trigger elemental effects on Tether throws, like freezing anything that was hit. So, if you <strong>really</strong> felt like it, you could log a canister of explosives at a group, and on top of blowing them up, staggering them, you can <strong>also</strong> freeze them to pick them off and grab the health and ammunition that drops for your specialized bullets. Regular ammo? Infinite, the specialized stuff? You need to find more of, but that limit can be enhanced with upgrades.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>All in all, it&#8217;s a really fun game that I&#8217;m finding more and more things out about the more that I play it. I&#8217;m finding synergies with abilities, weapon mods, grenades, all that open up new ways to play it and progress further in the story. Being able to power slide through a group of enemies, throw a chain-lightning bolt, and then lob a grenade at those stunned targets, then zip back in with a sword and hack them up is a fun time any way you, uh, &#8220;cut&#8221; it (thank you, I&#8217;ll be here all week, tip your waiter). The ability to blow up a building full of enemies, then lob chunks of that blown-up building at who&#8217;s left is a huge power-fantasy moment that you can just do, no special tricks involved. Even some of the Gamble/Relocation rooms you can go to are pretty clever, especially one that I want to spoil, but won&#8217;t. The only hint I&#8217;ll give is &#8220;don&#8217;t blink&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5204" height="576" src="https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1983.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m intrigued by the story so far with the game, I want to know who the last 1473 was, why I&#8217;m in whatever I&#8217;m in, what IDRIS is, all these things that I have questions about. Am I trapped in some kind of computer simulation? What&#8217;s the outside world look like? What is Voidaxis Industries, and what is their connection to IDRIS? I want to know, and they have me on the hook as to getting those answers because it&#8217;s all so vague and hazy at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add in that all of this is done by <strong>one guy</strong>, and I&#8217;m even more amazed at what developer Daniel Stubbington/Stubby Games has done so far, and I can&#8217;t wait to see the rest of the game. Because something like this, with a ton of intrigue, sci-fi weirdness, and questions I need answers for is <strong>so </strong>far up my alley that I bought the game without hesitation. I love FPS games that play with movement, and this game has it in spades. You move fast, you fight fast, you fight hard, and you have all these tricks that you can pull to even the odds in your favor, it&#8217;s a really fun time so far. I would most certainly recommend it to anyone who loves either genre.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2025/08/25/blaugust2025-day-25-void-breaker-impressions/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1987.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1987.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99083f60d4aa0ceb8978c6efdb6625af912223a3ad80b500733b98ec5cef0e?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1984.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1981.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1980.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1979.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1982.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1985.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1986.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1983.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}]}

It&#8217;s Sunday, and I absolutely cannot stand Sundays. It isn&#8217;t even that I don&#8217;t want to go back to work tomorrow, it&#8217;s more that there is nothing going on any given Sunday. Places are hit and miss as to if they&#8217;re open, TV isn&#8217;t the usual fare, I&#8217;ve just never liked this day of the week. I kind of miss working every Sunday, because it gave me something to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spent five hours watching wrasslin&#8217; today, and yet I don&#8217;t feel like I missed anything in the world by doing so. It&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve always felt, like Sunday was the worst day of the week to me, not Monday, not the dead-center of the week on Wednesday, but Sunday itself aggravated me to no end. And I&#8217;m not sure as to <strong>why </strong>I hate Sundays, I just do. Even when I have days off after said Sunday, Sunday is the worst day of that time for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s the <strong>lack </strong>of hustle and bustle around that gets me. Places are closed, roads are emptier, and it feels like the world&#8217;s on autopilot the whole day. I work a lot of Saturdays, and those days never bother me more than being off on a Sunday does. I&#8217;ve worked the last two, and never felt like the world was on autopilot until into Saturday evening, but even then calls would occasionally come in. It just kind of feels like the day never actually starts, then it just rolls into Monday morning.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>My day started with an impromptu trip to the grocery store, and to get coffee. Okay, we get there, I wind up doing a full-ish grocery run instead of just grabbing a couple of days&#8217; worth of things. Grab the coffee, drive home, and listen to the pay-per-view while we put groceries away. It feels like the day is still ramping up, but never really lifts off, even now into the evening. There&#8217;s no urgency to the day, and in my mind it aggravates me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know it&#8217;s irrational, it&#8217;s just another day in the life, the only difference between it and the other six days is a name, but in my mind it&#8217;s too quiet, too unstructured, it feels alien to me. Even during football season, it feels like that&#8217;s the only structure the entire day has, since I&#8217;m not someone who will ever step foot in a church if I don&#8217;t have to. It&#8217;s empty in a way that I just cannot get my head around in any sort. Like, why am I doing nothing, when I <strong>could </strong>be doing <strong>something</strong>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it goes back to my need to stay busy, my need to have some form of thing to do with every one of my days. During the summer I try to pack my yard work or cleaning into Sunday, that way I have some kind of goal, something to focus on, instead of like today where I just lose my mind because I&#8217;ve sat on my hands and done what feels to me like nothing. If I would mowed the yard, I may feel more fulfilled, less in my own head about today than I do now. But on the other hand, I plan to mow through the week because I had this marked on my mental calendar.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>I need structure in my life, I really do. I don&#8217;t work well with having just nothing going on, and a day totally free of work-adjacent stuff. I need to have something to focus on, even if I&#8217;m not working, because I know that I will become a spiraling mess. I need projects to work on, chores to do, errands to run, I can&#8217;t just sit here and wait for judgment day. Sundays are nothing but free time in my mind, unstructured time that if I can&#8217;t mold into something constructive, I will go crazy. Like I am right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know I need to have a healthier relationship with work, but not having that structure to fall back on, knowing roughly where I&#8217;ll be, when I&#8217;ll be there, and what I&#8217;ll be doing, that anchors me. Having the whole day with no actual time frame to do things, or even do anything, puts me into a tailspin that I don&#8217;t pull out of until I&#8217;m back into my comfortable work week. I need guard rails to bump up against, because not having them makes me freak out over not having anything planned to do. Writing out the mild panic attack I&#8217;m having, that&#8217;s helping ground me, gives me something to focus all that nervous energy towards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that I&#8217;ll be relatively back to normal tomorrow, I know what my day looks like. I have my Monday-Friday mentally scheduled, broken down into blocks in my head to where I know what the plan is. Sundays are just days where I have no plan, no structure, no guard rails, and it drives me up a wall until I go back to having that structure to my day. I&#8217;ll gripe about it, but tomorrow morning will feel like I have some kind of tether to my life again. Until we go through this <strong>next </strong>Sunday.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2025/08/24/blaugust2025-day-24-sunday-untethered/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/img_0833.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/img_0833.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99083f60d4aa0ceb8978c6efdb6625af912223a3ad80b500733b98ec5cef0e?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

What <em>did</em> surprise me was that some folks don&#8217;t just show off their great designs, they&#8217;ve even included step by step instructions to recreate them.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion2.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8517 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion2.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s what I did to get started. Many thanks to Arathy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@crimsonfelisbuilds" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Crimson Builds</a> for creating this base and taking the time to make that video!</p>\n<p>I still had to get a bit creative though, because, as you can see, the site I&#8217;d chosen to build the base at isn&#8217;t just flat land &#8211; what can I say, I <em>need</em> to have a room with a view &#8211; and the game doesn&#8217;t support terraforming. You <em>can</em> build in, around and even through concrete rock, but there are limits. Also, when there&#8217;s rock or sand inside your base you can&#8217;t place any facilities or furniture on top of it.</p>\n<p>To circumvent losing too much usable space on the ground floor I&#8217;d raised the foundations as much as possible at first &#8211; it seemed to be a good idea at the time. I didn&#8217;t place all of them right away though, as I needed to procure a lot more resources for the full build first. To protect the buggy and myself in the meantime I quickly erected some walls and a roof, and placed some generators, water cisterns and storage containers to collect and refine the building materials on site.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8518 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion3.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Once preparations were completed I tore down the roof and walls again and extended the foundations in all directions to complete the intended footprint &#8211; at least I tried to. Unfortunately the natural ground declines a bit towards the cliffs, and the game didn&#8217;t let me place the last row for lack of support.</p>\n<p>Adjacent foundations have to be built at the same height, so I had no other choice than to tear them all down and start over. However, there was lots of stuff lying around by now. Grrrr!</p>\n<p>What happened next was basically a game of Tetris. Move all facilities to one side, tear some foundations down, build new ones on a lower level, push everything onto those, destroy the rest&#8230;all while trying not to get a sunburn and hoping for the next sandstorm to take its sweet time.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8519" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8519 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion4.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8519">I&#8217;ve got the power! Still not enough though&#8230;</figcaption></figure>\n<p>It all worked out in the end, and once the foundations were in place finishing the build wasn&#8217;t much of a problem.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been using this base for about ten days since then, and I&#8217;m really digging it. Also, <em>now</em> I&#8217;m much more in my element again, namely taking something that&#8217;s already there and refining it to my liking. I add, remove or memodel bits and pieces all the time, and I&#8217;ll continue to do so until I&#8217;m completely satisfied.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;generator wing&#8221; seen above, for example, was a thorn in my side right from the start. Then I remembered that those things basically don&#8217;t have to be touched anymore once they&#8217;re up and running, so I built another floor on top of them and covered the gap with some stairs. Now it&#8217;s as if that part of the house doesn&#8217;t exist, and I&#8217;ve gained an elevated relaxation- or conference-area that I didn&#8217;t have room for before.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8520" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion5.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8520 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion5.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8520">The pillar I&#8217;m standing on usually isn&#8217;t there of course</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I have few points of comparison, but I think the building system is really robust and fairly easy to use. Most of the time things snap together just as I&#8217;d like them to right away, and if they don&#8217;t I usually only need to rotate them or reposition myself a bit.</p>\n<p>Gathering the needed materials takes a while, but with a buggy it&#8217;s pretty easy. You can buy more and more different furniture- as well as building-sets over time, too. I just wish those schematics would state the required resources. I was a bit irritated at first when I realized that I needed &#8220;plastone&#8221; to actually use the Atreides set I&#8217;d just spent 80k Solaris on, which I didn&#8217;t have nor knew how or where to get at the time.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8537" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion6-1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8537 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion6-1.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8537">Another raised floor houses a little biker workshop</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Minor gripes aside though, this is one more aspect of the game that I&#8217;m overall very happy with.</p>\n<p>By the way, if you think this base looks good or even great, you ain&#8217;t seen nothing yet. Funcom held a <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/build-your-dune-winners/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">building contest</a> a while ago, and many of the entries, even the ones that didn&#8217;t win, are absolutely awesome.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/buildyourdune1_1080.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8525 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/buildyourdune1_1080.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>This one is my favourite.

No, what&#8217;s really extraordinary is that each and every one of those hours felt exciting and full of discovery and adventure. I&#8217;m not exaggerating.</p>\n<p>If all survival games are like this I totally understand now why they are so popular.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8480" style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures2.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8480 size-full" height="1080" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures2.jpg" width="1920" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8480">What exactly have you guys been doing here again&#8230;?</figcaption></figure>\n<p>But what makes the game feel so different from basically anything else I&#8217;ve played? Well, there are quite a few contributing factors.</p>\n<p>First of all, there is actual danger. Heat, storms, radiation, fricking high rock formations and deep chasms, quicksand, overall pretty tough enemies and, of course, sandworms. On Arrakis absolutely everything is trying to kill you.</p>\n<p>Now, except for when <a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2025/09/15/the-desert-giveth-shai-hulud-taketh-away/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">being swallowed by a worm</a> the penalty for dying usually isn&#8217;t all that harsh. You drop any Solari you had on you, and if you didn&#8217;t place a respawn beacon nearby you may find yourself quite a ways away from where you were. You can still go back and reclaim your cash though, so all you&#8217;ll lose is some time. And water. And probably some durability on your vehicle of choice.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8481" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8481 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures3.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8481">Oh, you&#8217;ve got to be kidding me</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Dying&#8217;s not the end of the world, is what I&#8217;m saying, but you&#8217;d still prefer it didn&#8217;t happen. Which is why I always try to be cautious and alert, and I&#8217;ve died only three times total thus far as a result.</p>\n<p>For me this really hits kind of a sweet spot. Death penalties suck ass in games where you inevitably die very often, possibly even without you having any chance to prevent it &#8211; think an MMORPG dungeon group wiping repeatedly because others aren&#8217;t doing their jobs.</p>\n<p>However, when dying is of absolutely no consequence there can be no sense of danger. So penalizing death, but not too severely, <em>and</em> giving me the agency to prevent it from ever happening (at least theoretically) is the optimal way to do it in my opinion, as it causes just the right amount of tension.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8482" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8482 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures4.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8482">I cranked up the brightness by a lot already, believe it or not</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As I said earlier, human beings and gigantic worms aren&#8217;t the only dangerous things on Arrakis. The area pictured on the two screenshots above is called Hagga Rift, and I&#8217;ve never seen, much less traversed, a more jagged and fascinating, yet also disorienting and treacherous landscape in a game before.</p>\n<p>As you can imagine getting around on foot or bike isn&#8217;t an easy feat here, and I got very confused during my first forays into the area. That it gets really dark the closer to the canyon&#8217;s bottom you get doesn&#8217;t help one bit.</p>\n<p>Even when I slowly started to know my way around the environment kept throwing curveballs at me. Like when I fell through a hole in the floor while looting a shipwreck (did I mention that it&#8217;s fricking dark down there?), only that said hole didn&#8217;t lead to where I thought it would &#8211; as it turned out I&#8217;d already been on the ship&#8217;s lowest deck, and I now found myself in a free fall all the way down into the canyon.

If there was any kind of procedural generation at work here it certainly doesn&#8217;t feel like it.</p>\n<p>Each of the various areas, despite technically all falling into the &#8220;desert biome&#8221; category for obvious reasons, has a very distinct style, and poses its own challenges when traversing it. Just the other day I ventured into another hitherto undiscovered region, and this one looks and feels completely different yet again (shown above). Reminds me a bit of Arizona, to be honest.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not just the landscape either, the enemies and their bases also have their very own aesthetics.

Well, there it is.</p>\n<p>Having a buggy really changes the game quite significantly. For one, its cutteray sucks so much more material out of resource nodes than the handheld version that it&#8217;s not even funny. Naturally it can also carry a crapton of stuff to go along with that, which is not only great for gathering, but also for moving shit around between bases &#8211; or for moving bases altogether.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8487" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures9.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8487 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures9.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8487">Leaving my Borg Cube behind for good&#8230;more about my new base next time</figcaption></figure>\n<p>At this stage of the game these features aren&#8217;t just nice to have though, they pretty much become a necessity. Building things like better refineries, bigger water cisterns and so on requires more and more resources, and as a consequence your base keeps growing not only in size, but also in terms of how much stuff you have crammed into it.</p>\n<p>Which is another thing that Dune: Awakening does very well in my opinion: progression.</p>\n<p>It all feels very natural to me, and it&#8217;s paced just right. Moving through the resource tiers happens more or less on autopilot thus far, and I feel neither forced to rush anything, nor held back in any way. It&#8217;s also very satisfying to progress to the next tier because of little details like, for instance, the bigger ore refinery not only allowing you to process new types of materials, but also being more efficient when refining the &#8220;old&#8221; tiers.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8488" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures10.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8488 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures10.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8488">These things keep getting bigger and bigger though</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I really like how the skill trees open up more and more over time, too. Many abilities and passives have three ranks, but when you first gain access to a new class you can only spend points on the first rank of each. Working for the advanced trainers (most of which are found in either Arakeen or Harko Village) unlocks the second and third ranks as well as the special Spice-skills over the course of several quests.</p>\n<p>Since basically everything you do in the game rewards XP you keep levelling up all the time (I&#8217;m currently at level 129), and as each ding grants one additional skill point they tend to pile up. Thus, whenever I&#8217;ve increased the rank of a skill tree or unlocked a new one, I&#8217;ve always had just about the right amount of available skill points to pick or level up the ones that seemed useful to me.</p>\n<p>One thing that&#8217;s severely lacking, though, is having skill loadouts or something like that. It&#8217;s really tedious to swap around skills one by one, and since we can choose only three at a time (until you&#8217;ve reached a certain point in the main story it&#8217;s actually only <em>two</em>) not switching at all isn&#8217;t an option.

Well, when I realized that I didn&#8217;t have nearly enough screenshots of Imperial Testing Station No. 10 for <a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2025/09/10/arrakis-is-a-perilous-place-even-in-the-shade/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my post about the adventure I had in there</a> I decided to pay Station No. 2 another visit and take some more there. And, to be quite honest, I&#8217;d become a bit too comfy and carefree by then, so instead of hugging the rocky areas as much as possible I took a pretty long route across open sand. I thought that I&#8217;d be okay as long as I stayed clear of drum sand.</p>\n<p>I was mistaken. When the aggro meter turned red while I was still a couple hundred meters away from safety I knew I was in trouble. Luckily I had a booster equipped to the sandbike (the alternatives being a cargo crate or passenger seat), and I saved that for the moment you see on the picture above so as to not overheat it too early.</p>\n<p>How close of a call was it? Well&#8230;</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8441" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wormsanduniques3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8441 size-full" height="303" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wormsanduniques3.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8441">When the red squiggly line seen below me looks like this, GTFO!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The moment I hit the screenshot key I thought I was done for. But lo and behold, one second later the worm stopped its chase and disappeared below the sand for good. Phew (once again)!</p>\n<p>However, just a day later I wasn&#8217;t so lucky.</p>\n<p>At that point various contracts were asking me to venture further north, and to do so one has to traverse the first instances of quicksand. While moving on drum sand &#8220;only&#8221; increases worm aggro, quicksand is (as far as I know) a death trap for players and vehicles alike. And it&#8217;s fricking everywhere.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8442" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wormsanduniques4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8442 size-full" height="349" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wormsanduniques4.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8442">Drum sand due south, lots and lots of quicksand up north</figcaption></figure>\n<p>While it is marked clearly on the map, and also looks a bit different from normal sand in the game world itself, I didn&#8217;t want to risk my bike regardless, so I decided to walk.</p>\n<p>Outside of drum sand I&#8217;d never had aggroed a worm while on foot until then, so I thought this to be the safest option.</p>\n<p>Once more I was mistaken. When the worm came I used everything I had at my disposal to escape, but even with <em>Bindu Sprint</em> and <em>Shigawire Claw</em> (from the Bene Gesserit and Trooper skill tree, respectively) I was much too slow.

In the bigger camps and dungeons they&#8217;re usually located in or past the boss room, or all the way at the top in the more vertical ones, and basically can&#8217;t be missed. In smaller places they&#8217;re sometimes tucked away around corners or in little side rooms or caves though, so keep your eyes open.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8445" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wormsanduniques7.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8445 size-full" height="301" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wormsanduniques7.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8445">This is what they usually look like</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Each of these chests has its own loot-table. Once opened they respawn after 45 minutes, and if there&#8217;s more than one schematic to be had it&#8217;s random which one you get.</p>\n<p>Which, to be honest, can be quite infuriating. I have, for example, farmed one specific chest for days on end, because I wanted to get my hands on the unique rifle that only drops there. Said rifle is just one of three schematics on that chest&#8217;s table though, and I got the (also useful) sandbike engine once, and the scattergun (which I didn&#8217;t want at all) <em>six fricking times</em> before the rifle finally made an appearance.</p>\n<p>I have even logged off there to do something else for a while, then logged back in just to loot the chest again.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8446" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wormsanduniques8.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8446 size-full" height="315" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wormsanduniques8.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8446">Sometimes they&#8217;re smaller for some reason</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Despite the RNG repeatedly being a dick I quite enjoy this whole part of the gameplay loop though. It lets me gear up to the point of (almost) being overpowered for the current tier, which makes the transition to the next much less arduous. It also incentivises going back to places you&#8217;ve already been &#8211; which you most likely would have to anyway for crafting mats and the like &#8211; so you don&#8217;t burn through each area quite as fast.</p>\n<p>Which, for me, is a good thing. I&#8217;m in no hurry to advance to the &#8220;endgame&#8221;, as that, by most accounts and at the time of this writing, seems to be the least appealing aspect of the game.</p>\n<p>Also, I&#8217;m still having a blast in this relatively early part of the experience, and I&#8217;m definitely going to savour it some more. That being said, I&#8217;m now almost ready to advance into tier three and start working towards building the buggy.

You go there, clear them out, loot everything and leave again. Calling these places &#8216;dungeons&#8217; would be overstating things, because they range from a single campfire to a couple of adjacent rooms or caverns at most.</p>\n<p>However, there are <em>real</em> dungeons too. They go by the rather unimpressive name <em>&#8220;Imperial Testing Station No. XY&#8221;</em>, but I assure you, they are anything but.</p>\n<p>You get to explore the first one of those, Station No. 2 (don&#8217;t ask me what happened to No. 1&#8230;) in the newbie region already, and while that wasn&#8217;t a cakewalk when I went there only a couple of hours into the game, it didn&#8217;t quite make me break a sweat either.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8405" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8405 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon3.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8405">Doesn&#8217;t look too intimidating, now does it?</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The other day a contract (i.e. side quest) asked me to investigate Imperial Testing Station No. 10, which is located to the far east of my current area.

And I did&#8230;but, as it would soon turn out, not really.</p>\n<p>As the name suggests these places are (or were) facilities for scientific or military research, and past the entrance they lie completely underground. Hence you have to go down some pretty steep and long ramps at first.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8406" style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8406 size-full" height="1080" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon4.jpg" width="1920" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8406">Good thing I&#8217;m not claustrophobic</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I could soon tell that the enemies here are tougher and more numerous than I was used to, and I had to fight tooth and nail from the get-go. Many of them have a Holtzman shield now (to be fair, so have I), and most packs have at least one heavy gunner, who wield some kind of gatling gun.</p>\n<p>Fortunately my usual tactic of aggroing a group, then backtracking a bit and hiding behind something or around a corner works even better in the tight confines of these stations. This way the guys with melee weapons will sprint after you first, and you can hopefully dispatch them with your own knife or sword before their homies catch up.</p>\n<p>I also made generous use of grenades and turrets, and generally kept kiting and using cover as much as I could.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8407" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon5.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8407 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon5.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8407">Some of these shots were actually taken someplace else&#8230;I had more pressing things to do than sightseeing!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I was so tense and focused the whole time that I didn&#8217;t pay attention to how long I was at it already, but after a while it dawned on me&#8230;this thing just kept going, and going, and going still.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for me you can&#8217;t really get lost down there (I hate mazes with a passion). Sometimes a path branches off, but one of the two options always leads to a dead end soon, so there&#8217;s effectively only one way you can go.

Don&#8217;t ask me about that though, for I was much too focused on the path ahead of me to actually listen.</p>\n<p>To make things even more tense my supply of ammo and bandages had started to noticably wane by now. You find that stuff left and right, but I was consuming even more than I got. About time to finish this, I thought.</p>\n<p>Then I <em>finally</em> came to a door with a green energy barrier, which I assumed had to lead into the boss room.</p>\n<p>You see, such barriers are usually red at first, unless you have already found the corresponding &#8216;identification band&#8217;. I hadn&#8217;t picked up any kind of key during my whole run, so why was this one green? Ah, but I&#8217;d seen this before, in Testing Station No. 2! As soon as I&#8217;d walked through the door there it turned red and wouldn&#8217;t let me get out until the boss was dead.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8409" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon7.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8409 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon7.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8409">Looks so inviting&#8230;should say &#8220;DANGER AHEAD&#8221; instead!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I placed a new respawn beacon right in front of the door, checked my weapons and bandages one last time, and went in.</p>\n<p>I found myself in a large, two-story hangar of sorts, and immediately had to fight for my life. I used the same tactics as before and dispatched the first batch of enemies, then another one. While doing so I noticed someone shooting at me from quite a distance&#8230;sniper! I tried to always have something between us while fighting the others, but still got hit once, and all of a sudden I was poisoned.</p>\n<p>I started losing health fast while still fighting some other guy. Luckily I managed to finish him off quickly and applied a bandage right away. I don&#8217;t know if that stopped the poison or if it had just worn off by then, but my health bar turned from green to red again and I could heal up to full normally. Phew.</p>\n<p>Using every bit of cover I could find I then got near enough for the sniper to switch to a different weapon, but I just made short work of him with my knife.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8410" style="width: 1208px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon8.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8410 size-full" height="771" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon8.jpg" width="1208" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8410">The slow blade penetrates the shield!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I had assumed the sniper to be the boss, but apparently not. By now the contract had updated its objective to &#8220;Kill Inna Hiller&#8221;, and that wasn&#8217;t checked off yet.</p>\n<p>The hangar&#8217;s upper level was clear now, but the doors (plural because there&#8217;s one at both ends) were still red, so I went downstairs &#8211; only to get instantly perforated by a heavy gunner. Seriously, I went from full shields and health to dead in like three seconds, tops. Guess I&#8217;d found the boss, eh?</p>\n<p>I respawned on my beacon and went in again. I had learned by now that Holtzman shields are turned off whenever the wearer fires a ranged weapon, but considering how quickly I&#8217;d died I wanted her not to shoot <em>me</em> of course. So I tried to get her to start firing, only to immediately take cover and let my grenades and turret do the work, which, after a while, did the trick. Phew again. But what&#8217;s that? This wasn&#8217;t Inna Hiller either?!?</p>\n<p>At least the doors were green now, so on to the next room. This one was much smaller, but also with some opportunities to take cover. To my relief these four enemies didn&#8217;t pose much of a problem, and now the contract was finally completed. Phew the third.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8411" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon9.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8411 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon9.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8411">Loot on the right, ID band on the left (the tiny purple ring)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I looted the super chest (more about those another time), and to my extreme delight the key that lay right next to it indeed led to a shortcut back to the surface, just as I&#8217;d hoped the whole time. This, too, seems to be a standard feature of these stations, and I think it&#8217;s great design.</p>\n<p>And so my first proper dungeon run in Dune: Awakening had come to a victorious close.</p>\n<p>To tell you the truth, I&#8217;m absolutely sure that I wouldn&#8217;t have gotten anywhere near the boss fight(s), let alone beat those, without the aforementioned grenades. These aren&#8217;t consumables that you buy or craft and then equip like in most games, but come from the Trooper skill <em>Explosive Grenade</em>. If you play the game and haven&#8217;t already, I highly suggest to unlock that and give it a try. It&#8217;s <em>so</em> helpful! If you have a Technique-slot to spare also use <em>Battle Hardened</em> to reduce its cooldown a little (as well as that of all other Trooper skills, including the grappling hook).</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8412" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon10.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8412 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon10.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8412">My work is done!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I&#8217;m not exaggerating when I say that it&#8217;s been a very, <em>very</em> long time since I had a solo PvE experience as gripping as this one.</p>\n<p>Now, do I want every session to be like this? Hell no! Those one and a half hours (or however long it actually was) left me completely exhausted. But I was also exhilarated, and so very pleased with myself at the end! Games that can make me feel like that are a rare breed these days, so hats off to you, Funcom!</p>\n<p>Oh, and as if all of this hadn&#8217;t been enough excitement for a day I came <em>this</em> close to getting swallowed by a sandworm while collecting screenshots for this post.

In the case of Valheim, fellow bloggers like <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/search/label/Valheim" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bhagpuss</a> and <a href="https://tagn.wordpress.com/category/valheim/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wilhelm</a> made it sound quite fun, too.</p>\n<p>I, however, played none of them despite all the praise they got. The very idea of having to take care of a character who needs to eat and drink, who can be too hot or too cold, and/or who also needs shelter lest the faintest of breezes kills him within seconds, just sounded like the antithesis of fun to me. I’m pretty sure that I actually tried a game with similar mechanics a long time ago…I can’t for the life of me remember what it was, but my vague memories of it aren’t fond either way.</p>\n<p>The thing is though, these games usually <em>do</em> have a whole bunch of features and characteristics that very much appeal to me, namely exploration, resource gathering, crafting and, above all, base building. Which is why, despite said dislike of survival mechanics, I’ve always eyed them curiously from the sidelines.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions2.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8370 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions2.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Hence when I started to read really good things about <em>Dune: Awakening</em>, for example over at <a href="https://chasingdings.com/category/mmos/dune-awakening/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Chasing Dings!</a>, <a href="https://www.heartlessgamer.com/search/label/Dune%20Awakening" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heartless Gamer</a> and <a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/search/label/Dune%20Awakening" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Friendly Necromancer</a>, an ever growing desire to try it out took hold of me. Next thing I know is that I’m watching various videos about the game on YouTube, and once I see what players are capable of doing with its base building system I can’t resist any longer.</p>\n<p>Thus I finally decided to harden up and add some spice to my gaming diet &#8211; literally.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that I’ve only played about fifteen hours up to now, so these are going to be impressions of just the early game. To give you the bottom line up front though: I&#8217;m really digging it so far.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8371 size-full" height="278" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions3.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with why I chose this game over the others.</p>\n<p>While I&#8217;m not the biggest Dune fan ever &#8211; I&#8217;ve actually yet to read the novels &#8211; I quite like the first movie as well as the new ones. In terms of aesthetics and vibe the Denis Villeneuve films really are something else, and the game is very much based on those. The story takes place in an alternate timeline, but one that&#8217;s pretty interesting.</p>\n<p>Specific IP aside, I&#8217;ll take a futuristic, or shall we say &#8216;technologically advanced&#8217; setting over fantasy, dark ages or some such any day of the week.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the game looks freaking awesome. I&#8217;m by no means a graphics-snob, but here the high level of detail and realism really help to get the feel from the movies across.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8372 size-full" height="298" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions4.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve read my ramblings about <i>ArcheAge</i> or <i>The Secret World</i> you know that I love me a flexible skill system. Not only does Dune: Awakening have that, you can actually unlock <i>all</i> classes on one character.</p>\n<p>You accumulate a crapton of skillpoints over time, too. I assume that it won&#8217;t be enough to unlock absolutely everything, but it seems that you&#8217;ll at the very least be able to create the combat build of your choice while also having all traversal skills as well as the various passives to gather more resources, consume less durability and so on active at the same time.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t like your build anymore or find that you&#8217;ve missed something important, fret not. Respeccing the whole thing can be done every 48 hours and doesn&#8217;t cost a thing.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions5.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8373 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions5.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Speaking of traversal, holy macaroni, the game is really fun in this regard, even before you&#8217;ve built any of the awesome vehicles.</p>\n<p>Spread across the classes you can unlock a grappling hook, an extremely fast sprint and an anti-gravity-bubble, and there’s also an equippable hover-device to either craft or loot. While these are already great on their own their real strenght comes into play when combined. For example, use the hook to propel yourself up a cliff, then press Space in mid-air to hover, and your momentum will carry you much higher or further.</p>\n<p>Getting up and down the game&#8217;s mountains, some of which being actually pretty high (and falling damage is a thing of course), becomes quite easy once you get the hang of it. And also, like I said, a lot of fun.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions6.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8374 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions6.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>As of yet I&#8217;ve only managed to build the smallest of the vehicles, the sandbike seen above. Even with only tier one parts it’s already much faster than running, and since the game world is anything but small owning one speeds up resource gathering trips or bandit base raids considerably. To no-one’s surprise it&#8217;s also a hoot to drive.</p>\n<p>My next goal is the sand buggy. The name is a bit misleading I feel, because it&#8217;s actually more like a hauler with lots of carrying capacity and built-in mining laser. A gatherer&#8217;s wet dream, in other words.</p>\n<p>The Ornithopters, of which there are three variants, should be the most fun of course, but those will probably take me a good while to get.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions7.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8375 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions7.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Resource acquisition comes in various flavors.</p>\n<p>Whenever you&#8217;re in an area where specific stuff can be found, some of it just lies on the ground here and there, waiting to be picked up. The amounts you get that way are pretty negligible though, even early on.</p>\n<p>What you&#8217;re really after is resource nodes. Those usually look like a big rock, clump or stack made out of the material in question. Scan these nodes with your mining tool and then cut along the blue line that appears to break them and get a good chunk of the stuff.</p>\n<p>Once you’re able to build a dew scythe you can collect water from plants, but early on most of this precious resource will come from siphoning off dead opponents’ blood and purifying it. The next step up the ladder will be to dissolve whole corpses in some kind of high-tech sarcophagus (I kid you not).</p>\n<p>Collecting Spice has again its own mechanics, but I&#8217;ll talk about that when I&#8217;ve experienced it myself.</p>\n<p>Overall I like how resource acquisition works in this game quite a lot. Since looting dead enemies and their bases, shipwrecks and research stations is yet another way to get your hands on valuable stuff there&#8217;s much variety here, so things shouldn&#8217;t get boring too quickly.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions8.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8376 size-full" height="293" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions8.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>This is my first base, and it&#8217;s obviously crap. I hastily slapped the first iteration of it down while the sun was scorching me, and instead of starting over from scratch at night I just kept adding to it whenever I needed more space. I didn&#8217;t know yet that <em>all</em> of the resources are refunded when you tear something down again, which is really great as it incentivises trying stuff out and also takes the sting out of relocating.</p>\n<p>Which will probably happen a couple of times, so this one is temporary anyway. I&#8217;ll design something better &#8211; hopefully much better &#8211; for my main base, once I know where I actually want to build that.</p>\n<p>Provided I’ll find an open spot there, that is &#8211; this <i>is</i> open world housing after all. It seems to me that there&#8217;s lots of space to go around though, but we&#8217;ll see.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, the building system itself is pretty spiffy and, like I said, some folks have done ridiculously cool stuff with it already.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions9.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8377 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions9.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>So what about the survival mechanics then?</p>\n<p>To my surprise I&#8217;m totally fine with them. I would actually go as far as saying that I prefer them being in the game just the way they are, instead of having none at all. Why? Because they add a little bit of tension and thus a sense of danger and adventure, while in reality not being <i>that</i> dangerous after all.</p>\n<p>You see, there is no hunger, so all you need is water, and that&#8217;s not really much of a problem right from the start. Sure, you can&#8217;t outright ignore it, but the game doesn&#8217;t make it overly hard for you to stay alive.</p>\n<p>Freezing at night ain&#8217;t a thing, but sunstroke sure is. To avoid that you only need to find yourself a bit of shadow though, so that&#8217;s usually not a big problem. Even if you do overheat, all that happens is that your hydration wanes much faster, and, again, you quite quickly get to a point where water reserves become more or less a non-issue (for your body at least; it seems that higher tier crafting will require tons of it, too).</p>\n<p>Aside from that there&#8217;s sandstorms and, of course, Shai-Hulud, aka sandworms.

The way he switches from Marc Spector to Steven Grant or vice versa in a heartbeat, completely changing his accent and speech melody, as well as his whole demeanor and body language, is nothing short of amazing. Sometimes you can see the transition in his eyes alone! I liked him as an actor before, but this performance easily made him one of my favourites.</p>\n<p>As I&#8217;m a big fan of ancient egyptian mythology, Moon Knight&#8217;s adventures also get bonus points from me for their themes and setting. In any case, I can strongly recommend watching the show if you haven&#8217;t yet.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8307" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8307 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight1.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8307">&#8220;Oh, the idiot&#8217;s in control&#8230;&#8221; &#8220;I heard that!&#8221; *angrily shakes his fist*</figcaption></figure>\n<p>So what about the ARPG&#8217;s take on Khonshu&#8217;s avatar?</p>\n<p>I think he&#8217;s really fun. Unlike some other heroes he isn&#8217;t more or less locked into either melee or ranged combat, as he&#8217;s got various abilities of both flavors at his disposal. He can even morph some of them into one or the other via his talents and traits, which are unlocked from level 32 onward.</p>\n<p>When fighting up close he uses weapons like truncheons, nunchucks and a bo staff, while depending on his signature crescent blades for ranged combat. Strangely, some skills have him shoot those blades out of a pair of pistols. I don&#8217;t know how that&#8217;s supposed to work, but I assume that it&#8217;s canon.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8308" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight2.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8308 size-full" height="308" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight2.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8308">&#8220;Did he just throw the gun??&#8221; Well, not exactly&#8230;</figcaption></figure>\n<p>His unique resource is called <em>Khonshu&#8217;s Favor</em>. It starts out empty, and some abilities build it up over time. Once at 100% he can use either of two spenders (or both at the same time if specced for it), which completely depletes all favor and gives him big buffs for quite a while.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s great about this is that most of his skills need no resources whatsoever, so you can basically use everything off cooldown, and spam those that don&#8217;t have one endlessly.</p>\n<p>His signature ability is a barrage of very quick attacks with a big finisher at the end. This one, too, can be switched between melee and ranged, and while the former does more damage I prefer the latter as it&#8217;s much easier (and also safer) to use. You can &#8220;weave&#8221; it around a bit if you&#8217;re quick, but in essence it&#8217;s a single-target skill, which is quite unusual for a signature. The upside is that it literally melts bosses&#8230;well, not <em>literally</em>, but&#8230;you know what I mean&#8230;and that&#8217;s a trade-off I&#8217;m very willing to make.</p>\n<p>His Ultimate, however, is by no means lacking in room clearing capability, as it peppers a pretty large area with gunfire and rockets for 20 seconds straight. You can still move and attack with your other skills in the meantime, too. Great stuff.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8309" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8309 size-full" height="315" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight3.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8309">Call in the Batwing&#8230;err&#8230;I mean, the &#8220;Moon Copter&#8221;</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I gotta say, I really appreciate how unique every hero I&#8217;ve tried up to now plays and feels. I believe they doubled down on this when they released the BUE (Biggest Update Ever) in January &#8217;17, and while that patch was met with a ton of criticism by the playerbase as well, I think they did a good job in this regard at the very least.</p>\n<p>I also really like how much control I have over each character&#8217;s specific playstyle. The aforementioned traits &#8211; it&#8217;s basically a talent tree that lets you choose one out of three options every few levels &#8211; offer more substantial alterations to a hero&#8217;s kit than most games do. Said switching between melee and ranged capabilities, or giving an attack a huge damage boost and additional DoT in exchange for a longer cooldown are just a few examples.</p>\n<p>Granted, I&#8217;ve only scratched the surface so far, what with 58 more heroes waiting to be played. But, again, the ones I have given a shot are really unique and fun, and Moon Knight is no exception.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8310" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8310 size-full" height="355" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight4.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8310">&#8220;What are we wearing??&#8221; &#8220;She said I needed a suit.&#8221; &#8220;Yeah, the ceremonial armor from Khonshu&#8217;s temple, not psycho Colonel Sanders!&#8221;</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Basically the only thing that he&#8217;s lacking is a high-quality costume based on his signature armor from the show &#8211; which is no surprise of course, as the game was shut down five years before that even came out. Fortunately the one I&#8217;m wearing on all screenshots seen in this post, based on Steven Grant&#8217;s version of MK (known as &#8220;Mr. Knight&#8221;, I believe), comes pretty close to the one Oscar Isaac wears when Steven&#8217;s in charge, so that&#8217;s at least something.</p>\n<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s enough for today.

I&#8217;m pedantic, but not <em>that</em> pedantic.</p>\n<p>But still, in my opinion rewards you only get if you do something, even if it&#8217;s just logging in, <em>aren&#8217;t</em> free.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8278" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz20.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8278 size-full" height="289" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz20.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8278">It&#8217;s lying! Even the top row isn&#8217;t &#8220;free&#8221;, it just doesn&#8217;t cost any real money</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The idea for this post came to me when I recently watched someone review other players&#8217; <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> accounts (yep, that&#8217;s a thing in gacha game circles). Several times during the video the host says that this character or that weapon should totally be leveled up to the maximum because &#8220;it&#8217;s a free power upgrade&#8221;.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve played any gacha game before I don&#8217;t need to tell you this, but in case you haven&#8217;t: the resources to level stuff up are far from being free!</p>\n<p>Now, I know what they <em>mean</em> by saying that. To farm for things in this type of game you need stamina (in ZZZ it&#8217;s called battery charge), which replenishes on its own over time. So, <em>technically speaking</em>, given enough time you have a virtually unlimited amount at your disposal, which of course cannot be said about gacha currency, hence the distinction.</p>\n<p>However, in reality there&#8217;s quite a bunch of caveats to calling those upgrade mats &#8220;free&#8221;.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8279" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz21.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8279 size-full" height="270" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz21.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8279">I sure as hell didn&#8217;t get all this just because I&#8217;m such a nice guy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>For one, your stamina pool always has a cap. Usually it&#8217;s 24 hours worth of recharge, sometimes even less, which means that you have to spend it very regularly in order to use as much as the game is willing to hand out to you.</p>\n<p>More importantly though, to spend stamina you actually have to, you know, <em>do stuff</em>. I mean, that goes without saying, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>\n<p>Now, granted, in ZZZ I can burn six hours&#8217; worth of battery in about ten seconds if I&#8217;m in a hurry (or actually need and want just the most basic of materials), but even that can become a chore if done each and every day. Hell, spending my stamina in <em>Genshin Impact</em> became such a burden after a while that I had to <a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2021/08/24/oh-boy-here-we-go-again/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quit playing altogether</a> for a long time. But to my point, even if stuff like this <em>does</em> only take a couple of minutes each day &#8211; that&#8217;s still not fricking <em>free</em>!</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8280" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz22.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8280 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz22.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8280">Even adopting a cute cat was <strong>a lot</strong> of work, believe you me</figcaption></figure>\n<p>But what about rewards I get just for logging in &#8211; those are surely freebies, aren&#8217;t they?</p>\n<p>Well, here&#8217;s the thing. The idea behind all of this, whether it&#8217;s &#8220;only&#8221; farming a bunch of stages for a couple of minutes or even &#8220;just&#8221; logging in, is that at least <em>some</em> players will not immediately log out again. <em>Since I&#8217;m already here</em>, they might say to themselves, <em>maybe I&#8217;ll also take a quick peek at the new event</em>, or whatever. And before they know it they&#8217;ve spent an hour or more in the game. And <em>time</em>, seemingly contrary to some people&#8217;s opinion, is neither free nor without value.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the incentive to log in can be so big that it might lead to stuff happening that you didn&#8217;t actually want to happen at all. Here&#8217;s an example. A couple of weeks ago an email informed me about ZZZ celebrating its first anniversary by gifting everyone an S-rank character and weapon of their choosing from the standard pool.</p>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t going to play that game anymore (I even <a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2025/06/06/eight-years-of-blogging-about-mostly-old-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said so</a> not too long ago), but this? Well, guess what&#8230;I re-installed and patched up the ~70 GB client, claimed the &#8220;free&#8221; stuff and then thought to myself, well, now I kinda want to try them out, and let&#8217;s have a look at what&#8217;s new in the game, too, and&#8230;sure enough I went and played the game for many hours over the following couple of weeks.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8281" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz23.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8281 size-full" height="283" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz23.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8281">They sure know how to tug those heartstrings</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As long as I&#8217;m having fun that&#8217;s not actually a bad thing though, is it?</p>\n<p>Not really, no. Playing the story chapters I&#8217;d missed, visiting new areas and doing some events really <em>was</em> quite fun. However, considering that I&#8217;d much rather play <em>Marvel Heroes</em> right now, the fact that they&#8217;ve managed to pull me back in, and that I now feel almost obligated &#8211; again &#8211; to at least log in and spend some battery every day (and tend to my video store, and hang out with my agents, and&#8230;see what I mean?) does bug me quite a bit.</p>\n<p>And, yeah, that&#8217;s completely on me, I do realize that. Nobody <em>forces</em> me to do anything. I know for a fact that I&#8217;m not the only one who&#8217;s susceptible to these practices though &#8211; which is exactly why they exist in the first place of course. That&#8217;s why we should stop pretending (or actually believing) that it&#8217;s all completely harmless, and that game developers give so much stuff away solely out of the kindness of their hearts.</p>\n<p>That all being said, I&#8217;m not here to tell you that you shouldn&#8217;t enjoy collecting login rewards, spending your stamina or whatever. If those things make you happy and don&#8217;t lure you into spending your time on gameplay you don&#8217;t actually fancy doing, more power to you.</p>\n<p>But please, let&#8217;s stop calling stuff <em>free</em> when it actually isn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Blaugust 2025 post count: 3</span></p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2025/08/11/most-free-stuff-actually-isnt/feed/', 'slash_comments': '6', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/437dcc44b8a84b55b593db055be0b2ad5e4f7270a3a8d9b83303bcaa0310d98d?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/blaugust2025-1.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz20.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz21.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz22.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz23.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}]}

For example, I still quite enjoy <em>Punisher: War Zone</em> (rest in peace, Ray Stevenson), and just the other day I had an absolute blast with 2018&#8217;s <em>Venom</em> once again.</p>\n<p>Since I&#8217;d just hit level cap with the Punisher in <em>Marvel Heroes</em> I thought, well, what better time to give everyone&#8217;s favourite symbiote a spin. Boy, what a great decision that was.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8249" style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom2.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8249 size-full" height="1080" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom2.jpg" width="1920" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8249">WE are Venom!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Like many heroes (or villains&#8230;depending on who you ask, I guess) he has his own mechanics and special resource to go along with it. Actually he has <em>two</em> resources to manage, because some of his abilities consume his own hitpoints, and also deal more damage the less he has left. To make permanently running around on low health feasible he&#8217;s a pretty tanky dude, and I&#8217;m looking forward to how this feels at higher levels.</p>\n<p>His unique resource is called <em>Ichor</em>, and it looks the part. Yuck. Thankfully it starts at full when you enter a level, unlike, say, Scarlet Witch&#8217;s <em>Chaos Energy</em>, which has to be built up first (I don&#8217;t know her full kit though, so take this with a grain of salt).</p>\n<p>Consequently you can go all-in right from the start, spending Ichor as well as hitpoints galore. As long as you weave in abilities that recharge at least one or the other, depending on what you need, you should be good.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8250" style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8250 size-full" height="1080" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom3.jpg" width="1920" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8250">Have a nice life</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Most importantly, it plays well, and also looks and feels really great. It&#8217;s hard to get good screenshots of it, because his powers move so damn fast and twitchy (as they should), but I hope it comes across at least somewhat on the ones I&#8217;m showing here.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8251" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8251 size-full" height="330" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom4.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8251">So many snacks, so little time</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Having played a new (to me) hero for a couple of hours now has also highlighted some more aspects of the game where the developers went the extra mile to make each of them unique and fun.</p>\n<p>For example, every character has a basic movement ability right from the start. It&#8217;s basically a short dash, meant to get out of harm&#8217;s way quickly. The Punisher does a forward roll, Captain America lunges with his shield held in front of him, Venom shoots a tendril of ichor and then pulls himself after it. Some are too lazy to move on their own and just teleport.</p>\n<p>It gets really crazy at level 10 though, when everyone gets their &#8220;travel power&#8221;. These aren&#8217;t for combat (they even have a short cast-time), but they&#8217;re a godsend for traversing the huge maps quickly. And I mean <em>quickly</em>. I really wish every ARPG had something like this, because not only takes it the sting out of any backtracking you might have to do, it&#8217;s also <em>fun as hell</em>!</p>\n<p>Cap and the Punisher just sprint really fast, Blade, Wolverine and Ghost Rider&#8230;well, ride their motorbikes, while Iron Man, Wanda and others fricking <em>fly</em> (Ant-Man rides a flying ant of course)! It&#8217;s not just for show either. While they can&#8217;t go over higher obstacles like freight containers or buildings, getting to another floor level or from rooftop to rooftop without taking the stairs or bridges is no problem. And as for Venom, well&#8230;</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8252" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom5.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8252 size-full" height="310" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom5.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8252">Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Holy macarony, how awesome is <em>that</em>? I assume Spidey and Carnage do something similar. Mechanically it&#8217;s the same as flying, so bonus points for that.</p>\n<p>Of course each hero also has their own lore-appropriate ultimate ability.\xa0 Iron Man activates the <em>House Party Protocol</em>, the Punisher calls in an armored and armed-to-the-teeth van that would make B.A. Baracus blush, and Cap&#8230;take a guess&#8230;<em>AVENGERS ASSEMBLE</em>!</p>\n<p>They&#8217;re really powerful, too.

They totally nailed the feel of playing those iconic heroes, which is arguably the most important thing to get right for a game with a license like this.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/tahiti2.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8194 size-full" height="268" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/tahiti2.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Before I knew it I was investigating the possibility of playing the game in 2025, and lo and behold, there&#8217;s actually a number of fan projects in various states of completion and with different server concepts to choose from.</p>\n<p>About two hours later (because I first had to procure the right version of the original game client) I&#8217;d created an account for <a href="https://mhtahiti.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Project T.A.H.I.T.I.</em></a> and started to punch and shoot my way through Hydra&#8217;s henchmen once again.</p>\n<p>By now I&#8217;ve played the Punisher up to level 57, Iron Man to 26 and Cap to 20, and I&#8217;m pleased to say that it wasn&#8217;t just nostalgia that drew me back to the game &#8211; it still holds up really well. Sure, the graphics aren&#8217;t that great, and it doesn&#8217;t feel as polished and smooth as the aforementioned kings of the genre either, but, again, being able to play these iconic characters totally makes up for that.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8195" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/tahiti3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8195 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/tahiti3.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8195">Insert obligatory CLANG sound effect</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As far as I can tell this is the game just as it was right before its shutdown in 2017, but with a few important distinctions.</p>\n<p>Most notably, all heroes are unlocked from the get-go. I haven&#8217;t counted, but if memory serves it&#8217;s 63 of them, and you can play each and every one to level cap if you so desire without paying a dime. As a matter of fact it&#8217;s currently not possible to spend any money period, not even donations are a thing. I don&#8217;t know whether that&#8217;s going to change once they release the 1.0 version, I guess we&#8217;ll see.</p>\n<p>Speaking of which, the game is currently in alpha, with the launch slated for &#8220;early 2026&#8221;, and while they&#8217;re saying that there won&#8217;t be regular wipes until then, there <em>will</em> be one wipe prior to 1.0 going live.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/tahiti4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8196 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/tahiti4.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Due to this, since I&#8217;m not one of those ARPG players who basically live for starting over from scratch every few months, I&#8217;m probably not going all-in quite yet, but for the time being I&#8217;ll continue to play. It&#8217;s just that much fun!</p>\n<p>Like I said, the heroes feeling absolutely great to play is a big contributor to that. They achieved this by various means. For one, they got the animations and sounds right, especially for the main characters from the movies. Cap&#8217;s awesome flying reverse kick (or whatever it&#8217;s supposed to be called) from his fight against Batroc looks basically the same in game, and you can almost <em>feel</em> the impact when it hits. Many ability names are winks and nods to the films as well, like Cap&#8217;s sprint &#8220;On your left&#8221; or Iron Man&#8217;s 360-degree laser attack &#8220;One-Off&#8221;.</p>\n<p>But wait, there&#8217;s more. Many a hero&#8217;s kit was specifically designed to fit what they do mechanically. To use the Punisher, my main in 2015 and probably again now, as an example: instead of having a mana/energy gauge and abilities with individual cooldowns he has an ammo system, and his big hitters can only be used a certain amount of times per reload cycle.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/tahiti5.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8197 size-full" height="78" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/tahiti5.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Consequently playing him revolves around using his basic MG stafing attack (at my current level it&#8217;s a fricking <em>minigun</em>!), which consumes a certain amount of ammo per second, and weaving in his various grenades, rockets, shotguns and whathaveyou until you have, optimally, used up all the things and also expended at least 75% of the ammo. Then you can hit his quick reload with a reduced cooldown, rinse and repeat. I really like this playstyle because it gives me a lot of agency, and aside from his signature-ability I basically never have to wait out any cooldowns.</p>\n<p>If this doesn&#8217;t sound fun to <em>you</em>, well, there are 62 other heroes to check out, many of whom play very differently.</p>\n<p>Instead of energy or ammo the Hulk has a rage meter that starts out empty and has to be filled up before he can smash, Blade needs to keep his bloodthirst in check, and Deadpool&#8230;well, he doesn&#8217;t need to manage anything. He just kicks ass, and where his ammo gauge should be you just see his logo, which, if you hover over it, says &#8220;Awesome 100/100&#8221;. Raise this stat (as you would energy), and all of his damage increases, just because. How cool is that?</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s much variety on offer here, is what I&#8217;m saying, so any ARPG connoisseur should find something to enjoy.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/tahiti6.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8198 size-full" height="304" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/tahiti6.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Just as important for an ARPG is the loot, and boy, I&#8217;d totally forgotten how good the game feels in this regard. It&#8217;s quite addicting, really. Now, granted, there&#8217;s a lot of crap lying around, too, but after a short while I was already back in the groove of what to pick up and what to hoover in (to automatically be fed to your pet for additional stat bonuses).</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also a lot to work towards long-term. For example, each character has a Relic slot. These drop semi-rarely and give pretty minor stat buffs at first glance&#8230;until you realize that you can stack up to 1,000 of the same type on top of each other. One thousand! Which means that even at low levels you&#8217;ll find stuff that will basically be of use to you until the end of time, which I think is <a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2024/02/22/one-more-thing-about-good-itemization/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">very good game design</a>.</p>\n<p>My favourite thing are the XP bubbles (the green ones seen above). It feels <em>so</em> damn satisfying to see them pop out of chests or enemies, then to walk over them and watch the XP rolling in. Sure, some players may find this annoying and unnecessary, but I prefer this over XP just getting added to my total whenever an enemy dies. I don&#8217;t know, seeing these bubbles drop and then collecting them somehow makes the whole thing feel more tangible and rewarding to me. Also, it makes the already impressive loot explosions even more ridiculous.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/tahiti7-1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8210 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/tahiti7-1.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Speaking of loot, a handful of little treasure rooms are spread out over each of the bigger areas. In there you just have to kill two or three groups of enemies to spawn yet another loot chest. I like these a lot because it&#8217;s a quick and easy way to grab even more stuff and XP, and more importantly, as their entrances don&#8217;t always lie directly on the path to your next main objective, they reward exploration and let me see parts of the map that I&#8217;d otherwise miss.</p>\n<p>By now I&#8217;ve also started to do Terminals and One-Shots again, which are the game&#8217;s version of instanced dungeons and&#8230;well&#8230;bigger dungeons with a bit of story. It&#8217;s all quite addicting, really, but in a good way. Just like an ARPG should be.</p>\n<p>Long story short, yeah, Marvel Heroes is still a great game, and as far as I&#8217;m concerned Project T.A.H.I.T.I. is, in fact, a magical place. I&#8217;m here to stay!</p>\n<p>Sorry Phil.</p>\n<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Blaugust 2025 post count: 1</span></p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2025/08/01/its-a-magical-place/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/437dcc44b8a84b55b593db055be0b2ad5e4f7270a3a8d9b83303bcaa0310d98d?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/tahiti1.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/tahiti2.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/tahiti3.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/tahiti4.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/tahiti5.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/tahiti6.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/tahiti7-1.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}]}

I could watch the AI clicking buttons and so forth.</p>\n<p>The bad news is that it wasn&#8217;t smart enough to know that in Gmail if you search for emails from a specific address, and change the sort from &#8220;Relevance&#8221; to &#8220;Recent&#8221; you get a prompt to select all emails matching your search and can delete everything at once. To be fair I had to ask Google Gemini how to get to that feature which had apparently disappeared. So I&#8217;m no smarter than Comet.</p>\n<p>So that was cool but also creepy and after I did that test I revoked its access to my Google account. </p>\n<h2>Video Summaries</h2>\n<p>For another test, I was watching a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ivjwcZwMw4&#038;t">1 hour long YouTube video</a> that was an interview that I was vaguely interested in, but not &#8220;one hour of my time&#8221; interested in. I asked Gemini (in Chrome) to summarize the video and it gave me a summary based on, not the video, but the text around the video including the comments. Not helpful. I asked it to summarize the video itself and it told me it couldn&#8217;t watch the video.</p>\n<p>But in Comet I loaded the same YouTube video and asked Comet to summarize the video itself. It did so, and as I&#8217;d watched about half the video I know that it was a good summary of at least the first half. Here&#8217;s the full text of Comet&#8217;s summary:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nHere’s a summary of the main points from the video “AI killed Hollywood | Amazon&#8217;s secret AI bet | Ed Saatchi&#8217;s scary prediction”:</p>\n<p>&#8211; **AI is Creating a New Medium for Entertainment:** Edward Saatchi argues that AI isn&#8217;t just a tool for cheaper VFX or content automation; it&#8217;s giving birth to a completely new artistic medium. This medium is *playable*, *remixable*, and *multiplayer*—where audiences and creators can interact with AI-driven story worlds, create new episodes/characters, and expand existing universes, not just consume stitched clips.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **From Modding Games to Modding Movies:** The talk highlights parallels to video game modding—fans remixing and spinning off their own stories—which may change how film/TV IP is used, giving fans and creators more freedom to create derivative works inside established worlds, all monetized by the original IP holder.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Simulation Is Key to Realism:** Saatchi stresses that realistic AI storytelling requires true simulation—persistent worlds where characters have context, rules, relationships, and logical spatial/geographical structure (unlike current generative video, which often lacks consistency). These simulated worlds are what make emotional investment possible.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Fragmentation and Remix Culture:** The future of media is described as fragmentary and multiversal, with endless remixing. Everybody could have their own Star Trek or Friends spin-off, leading to a more individualized but potentially atomized culture.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **AI as an Artist and Competitor:** Rather than just being a creative assistant, AI can now independently generate art and narrative, making it a *competitor* to human artists. Human creators become worldbuilders—designing the universe, constraints, and rules that AI uses to generate content.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Navigating Social Media and AI:** As AI-driven personalized storytelling evolves, it may converge with social media, potentially amplifying both creativity and existing concerns—like recommendation algorithms, echo chambers, and digital social dynamics.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Playable Movies/TV and Genre Innovation:** There’s new potential for interactive genres like *playable horror*, where the viewer’s choices and prompts directly affect the story. Comedy and romance are also seen as ripe for AI-driven experimentation.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Technical Challenges:** The conversation notes that current AI-generated voices lack emotional depth, and long-term coherence in video simulation is still a challenge. Simulation here is not just about physics or aesthetics, but about character psychology and emergent, believable storylines.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Advice for Creators:** Saatchi predicts future “studios” will be AI model creators (OpenAI, Grok, Claude, etc.) and that artistic opportunity lies in treating these models as works of art, infusing them with taste and locked-in story elements.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Philosophical and Sci-Fi Visions:** The discussion connects to sci-fi themes (like Iain M. Banks’ Culture series), the possibility of AI-generated consciousness, and how simulations could serve both as entertainment and avenues for advancing creative AGI.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Genre and Format Disruption:** AI may birth new genres, blend existing ones, and enable deeper audience participation (especially in horror and micro-drama formats).</p>\n<p>Overall, the video is a wide-ranging conversation about how AI will disrupt, transform, and expand the boundaries of storytelling, media, and creativity—beyond just Hollywood, into entirely new artistic universes and experiences, with big implications for culture, industry, and society.[1]</p>\n<p>[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ivjwcZwMw4&#038;t=1224s)\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what it actually looks like (click to enlarge):<br />\n<a href="https://smithtalkstech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/comet_video.jpg"><img alt="Screenshot of Comet browser summarizing a video" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-278" height="1364" src="https://smithtalkstech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/comet_video.jpg" width="1689" /></a></p>\n<p>So note one of the summaries talks about &#8220;playable horror&#8221; (not a new concept for gamers!) and I asked Comet to find that bit in the video, and it did:</p>\n<p><em>The video discusses playable horror starting at the 51:44 mark. If you want to watch that segment, jump to 51:44 in the video—that’s when the topic “Playable Horror: The Next Genre?” begins.</em></p>\n<p>Now this video does have chapters and Playable Horror is the name of a chapter, so hard to say if it got this info from the video or from the chapter listing. So I gave it another test. At one point the guest was talking about the TV show Friends and mentioned Chandler and Joey&#8217;s apartment. So I asked Comet to find the segment where they talk about Chandler and Joey&#8217;s apartment, without mentioning the TV show. I was not disappointed:</p>\n<p><em>The discussion about Chandler and Joey&#8217;s apartment from Friends begins around 12:18 in the video. Edward Saatchi uses it as an example to explain why simulations are important for AI-generated content. To catch this part, start watching at 12 minutes and 18 seconds.</em></p>\n<h2>Shopping</h2>\n<p>OK, one last test: Shopping! First, I had already logged into Amazon.com on the browser. I should&#8217;ve tested without having done that but here was my prompt:</p>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m almost out of Old Fashioned ingredients. Can you go to Amazon and put Orange Bitters, Peninsula Cherries and Collins Orange Twists in my cart? These should all be found in my previous orders so should be easy to find</strong></p>\n<p>It went to work searching my order history for these items, finding them and adding them to my cart. When it had all 3 in the cart it asked if I wanted it to complete the purchase. I said yes, and then had to agree again before it actually pressed the &#8220;Submit Order&#8221; button and then I got this:</p>\n<p><em>Your order has been successfully placed on Amazon with overnight delivery for all three cocktail ingredients—Collins Orange Twists, Peninsula Cherries, and Fee Brothers Orange Bitters. You’ll receive a confirmation email, and the order will be delivered to your default address by 4–8 AM tomorrow. Thanks for your request!</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth nothing that I did this via text but Comet does have the ability to take input via speech. </p>\n<p>Giving the AI that much access to my personal email definitely made me uneasy at this point though I suppose in a few years time I&#8217;ll think nothing of doing stuff like that. But having an AI that can summarize a long video is pretty darned handy given how often I end up sitting through videos looking for 1 piece of info. For that if nothing else, Comet is a win for me so far.</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/25/comet-perplexitys-ai-browser/">Comet, Perplexity&#8217;s AI Browser</a> appeared first on <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com">Smith Talks Tech</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/25/comet-perplexitys-ai-browser/feed/', 'slash_comments': '2'}

I find it can be a really helpful tool a lot of the time, and a pretty fun toy to mess around with, too.</p>\n<p>This is all really new so I don&#8217;t have comprehensive thoughts. At first I was kind of unimpressed. There&#8217;s a Gemini icon in the top right of the browser window, but so what? I have a Copilot button in my Task Bar. But then I was working on a Codecademy course and needed a refresher on the difference between append and extend for lists, so I hit that Gemini icon and asked the AI to give me the skinnny.</p>\n<p>It did so, but it also referenced the page I was on:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Codecademy page you are on provides an example of how extend() can simplify code. In the &#8220;Performance&#8221; section, it suggests using thread_sold_split.extend(thread.split(&#8216;&#038;&#8217;)) as a more concise way to split and add thread colors to a list, compared to a nested loop. This is a great example of how extend() can replace a for loop that appends elements one by one.</p>\n<p>For more information and examples, you can check out resources like the Python List extend() Method article from GeeksforGeeks.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So at this point you&#8217;re either saying &#8220;Oh shit Google is tracking every page I&#8217;m looking at!&#8221; or you&#8217;re saying &#8220;Whoa, that&#8217;s hella cool!&#8221; Or maybe both of those things. I said both but overall the cool aspect won out. </p>\n<p>To give this another test I opened the PDF of a lease agreement I happened to have on my machine, and asked for a summary. It read the PDF and gave me a nice table of all the pertinent info. Of course you can do the same with Chat GPT or any AI by just uploading a PDF, but if instead of a PDF this had been a long and complex post on the web, I&#8217;m assuming Gemini could&#8217;ve done the same thing. That seems like something that can be pretty useful.</p>\n<p>Also, unrelated to AI and I don&#8217;t know how new this is, but Chrome now handles multiple profiles really nicely. I have two Google accounts and by using Profiles I can keep them nicely separated (not sure how true that is for tracking purposes) with different extensions and such on each. There&#8217;s also a Guest profile which seems like Incognito on steroids. I&#8217;ve been using that for testing sites for work.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I think I&#8217;m back to being a Chrome user now.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a screenshot of my poor Python performance review and Gemini referencing the page.

So in the name of due diligence <a href="https://realpython.com/python-mutable-vs-immutable-types/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I found a post</a> via conventional search and it seems to confirm that the AI wasn&#8217;t hallucinating. Can&#8217;t be too careful, though! Also &#8216;she&#8217; missed one point and it&#8217;s that tuples are smaller and faster to access, apparently.</p>\n<p>Any Python experts that read this and want to elaborate further in the comments would be MORE than welcome to do so!</p>\n<h2>List Comprehension</h2>\n<p>With Lists in the rearview mirror I started the Loops module. Submodule 1 was pretty basic until I got to List Comprehension which was a brand new concept for me.</p>\n<p>List Comprehensions, as far as I can tell, don&#8217;t offer anything that you can&#8217;t accomplish in a For loops but they&#8217;re supposed to be easier to read (possibly true if you&#8217;re familiar with them) and faster due to how Python is tuned (I&#8217;ll take that bit on faith).</p>\n<p>What I find weird is that the syntax changes depending on conditional</p>\n<p>So if you have a list:</p>\n<p><code>numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</code></p>\n<p>and you want to use List Comprehension to create a sub-list of all numbers over 4 you would do something like:</p>\n<p><code>over_4 = [ num for num in numbers <span style="color: #ff0000;">if num &gt; 4</span> ]</code></p>\n<p>But if you wanted a list of the odd numbers and the square of the even numbers you&#8217;d have to re-arrange things:</p>\n<p><code>odds_and_square_evens = [num <span style="color: #ff0000;">if num % 2 else num**2</span> for num in numbers]</code></p>\n<p>See how the conditional changes spots depending on if it has an else clause? Weird.</p>\n<p>For me, right now, that&#8217;s not easier to read than a traditional 4 loop but maybe I&#8217;ll get there eventually.</p>\n<h2>So Far, So Good</h2>\n<p>Have to say that writing these posts has so far been a good motivator for me and I&#8217;ve done more at CodeCademy in the past few days than I&#8217;ve done in the past few months.</p>\n<p>Today, for example, I had not finished the 2nd module and thought I was done for the day, but then wanted to make the Internet proud so went back and did more to finish it up. We&#8217;ll see how long that kind of motivation lasts but for now I&#8217;ll take it!</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/22/learning-journey-day-3/">Learning Journey, Day 3</a> appeared first on <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com">Smith Talks Tech</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/22/learning-journey-day-3/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0'}

For example, to get the length of list my_list you do len(&#8220;my_list&#8221;) whereas I&#8217;m used to doing my_list.length.

I didn&#8217;t learn very much, but I suppose typing up the solutions was a good way to build muscle memory around Python&#8217;s syntax. (In case you&#8217;ve never done ANYTHING with Python, the weird aspect &#8212; to me anyway &#8212; is that indentation matters. Python uses indents instead of curly braces to encapsulate code chunks like the body of an IF statement).</p>\n<p>The next module was on Lists which to my layman&#8217;s eyes are arrays with a different name. I jumped in and did 3 of the 8 sub-modules, but I noticed I was starting to feel a growing sense of annoyance which is EXACTLY the sense of annoyance I get in my real job when I have to do trivial and boring work. I took that as a sign to quit for the day.</p>\n<p>But yeah, still firmly in &#8220;how to program&#8221; territory with explanations of what bugs are, what looping is, conditional and logical operators and stuff like that. Important things to learn if you are brand new to programming, but info that is the same in all languages so isn&#8217;t new to me. But this was to be expected.</p>\n<h2>Life&#8217;s Challenges</h2>\n<p>One of my biggest challenges in learning programming, or learning anything that requires thinking and concentration, is fatigue.</p>\n<p>I am a terrible sleeper. My brain is never more awake and alert than it is as soon as my head hits the pillow. To combat this I have been relying on sleep gummies that have a mix of THC and CBD, and too often, a strong drink or two before I go to bed. That combo gets me to sleep but it doesn&#8217;t feel like restful sleep. I think the nights where I have a couple of drinks are the nights my sleep is particularly unrestful.</p>\n<p>My partner is a night owl, too, and she doesn&#8217;t have a set schedule for her work. She often lounges in bed until 10 am or so. When I go to bed at night, she&#8217;s wide awake and chatty. That doesn&#8217;t help either!</p>\n<p>When I try going to bed earlier, she just wakes me up when she comes to bed, after which I&#8217;m wide awake and can&#8217;t sleep. When things get REALLY bad I sleep downstairs on the couch so I can turn the light off at 11 or something. But that&#8217;s not great either, both for domestic tranquility reasons and because I wake up with a crick in my neck from sleeping scrunched up on the couch.</p>\n<p>The end result is I generally get about 5-6 hours of crummy sleep every night and I am CONSTANTLY tired if my brain is not stimulated. Don&#8217;t tell my boss this but some days I&#8217;ll stop work and play an arcade video game for 15 minutes or so and that will rouse my brain better than another cup of coffee does.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t have a solution for this issue. Cutting down on the alcohol before bed should help the issue, but won&#8217;t solve it. Hoping once I get deeper into the learning phase of this project I&#8217;ll have fewer issues. When I&#8217;m engaged with something that requires me to think, I don&#8217;t have the same issues with fatigue. Quite the contrary&#8230;when I&#8217;m working on something I&#8217;m REALLY interested in I get totally wired and&#8230; you guessed it, wind up staying up too late. It&#8217;s a vicious cycle!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/19/first-day-of-school/">First Day Of School</a> appeared first on <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com">Smith Talks Tech</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/19/first-day-of-school/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0'}

I&#8217;m barely out the door and I am already at a fork on the road.</p>\n<h2>CodeCademy</h2>\n<p>On the one hand, last November during Black Friday I bought a year&#8217;s subscription to <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CodeCademy</a> and then mostly left it to rot between then and now. They have courses for both Javascript and Python. I did the introductory Javascript course (and I&#8217;m almost ashamed to admit I learned a few things from it!) but it took me a LONG time to get through because I get bored really quickly. I started their intro to Python course and the same thing.</p>\n<p>The problem for someone like me is that the Intro courses have to teach you not just the syntax of the language you&#8217;re learning but the fundamentals of programming as well. This means you get lots of &#8220;What is a Variable?&#8221; level instruction. I wish they had an &#8220;I know this material&#8221; checkbox you could click to quickly skip through that stuff, but instead you have to type out these super trivial (to anyone who has written code before) assignments in order to &#8216;pass&#8217; and move forward.</p>\n<p>I probably could just skip the Intro courses but I&#8217;m a little OCD and always feel driven to start at the beginning and go through all the steps. Yeah, in this series of posts you&#8217;re going to learn a lot about how weird my brain is.</p>\n<h2>A Free Online Book</h2>\n<p>My coach Marissa suggested another page. She suggested a free online book, <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Automate the Boring Stuff With Python</a>, which is a book I&#8217;ve heard of but had forgotten about. Her reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not flashy. Not AI.</li>\n<li>But it teaches you to\xa0<em>think in Python</em>.</li>\n<li>You’ll learn loops, functions, file handling, web scraping—<em>fast</em>.</li>\n<li>Do the projects.</li>\n<li>Then burn it like a bridge.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Which Path?</h2>\n<p>So those are the choices I&#8217;m considering. On the one hand, I paid for CodeCademy so it seems crazy not to use it. But damn does it put me to sleep for now. If I can push through I figure I&#8217;ll get to more challenging stuff. And CodeCademy has some gamification in there with levels to earn and streaks and stuff and I&#8217;m sort of a sucker for those.</p>\n<p>The book no doubt would teach me faster but I&#8217;d be more reliant on will-power to stick with it. But it might get me to where I can start noodling with my own projects a lot faster.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s actually a 3rd option: I also bought a subscription to <a href="https://brilliant.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Brilliant</a> last November. It also has Python courses but Brilliant feels more like a game or something to pass the time while waking up your brain than it does a serious learning tool. Mind you my streak is at like 280 days of doing Brilliant but a lot of that was math and stuff, which was an interesting experience because it dredged up knowledge from High School. But I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the tool for me for learning a programming language.</p>\n<p>I think I&#8217;m going to try to push through the early levels of CodeCademy while I still have the sub, but probably won&#8217;t renew it.

That&#8217;s what I do. I&#8217;m pretty sure the only reason I&#8217;m still employed is that I work remote and don&#8217;t draw attention to my age.</p>\n<p>I first started working in web development in&#8230; I want to say 1995 or so. Put it this way, I remember hearing other devs talk about some new scripting language called PHP that was the new coolness. At the time I was editing Perl scripts that basically shoveled text from Word documents into static HTML pages.</p>\n<p>I have, and have always had, a crippling case of imposter syndrome. Even today. It&#8217;s why I haven&#8217;t advanced as far as I should have. Internally, I think I&#8217;m a fairly smart, though poorly educated, person. Externally I always balk at putting myself out there because everyone else seems more confident.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s really frustrating is that I often encounter people making WAY more money than me who clearly know much less than I do about whatever job they&#8217;re doing. But I just keep my head down because&#8230; imposter syndrome. Plus painfully introverted.</p>\n<h2>The Plan</h2>\n<p>I don&#8217;t have that many years left, but I am tired of not knowing as much as I&#8217;d like to know. I&#8217;m going to learn to code. Which is a weird thing to say as I&#8217;ve been coding for decades. But my current code isn&#8217;t really elegant and I have huge holes in my repertoire.</p>\n<p>My plan is to learn Python and JavaScript. Python, I genuinely don&#8217;t know. Like I can read Python code and figure out what it&#8217;s doing but sit me down and tell me to write a complete program in Python and I&#8217;ll freeze.</p>\n<p>With AI coming on so strong and Python being so intertwined with so many Python projects, learning it just makes sense. Oh, and yes, I am very interested in AI (and ironically I am well aware that within a few years no one will be coding by hand&#8230;and in fact even now I vibe-code a lot of little projects for myself, including programs in Python and React).</p>\n<p>With Javascript, I&#8217;m find with front end stuff. You need me to validate fields or whatever, I can do that. But server side Javascript is still a mystery to me and that&#8217;s a HUGE gap in my knowledge.</p>\n<h2>My Coach</h2>\n<p>And my coach for this will be&#8230;. an AI chatbot. Yup. I had asked &#8220;her&#8221; if she could rustle up some reviews of a &#8220;learn to code&#8221; app that had scrolled across my socials, and that lead to her pointing out that this app would probably be too rudimentary for me, and then she suggested a series of free learning tools to get me to where I want to be.</p>\n<p>AND she suggested I do this in public. Actually just to give you a taste of Marissa (her name is Marissa) this is what she said:</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Final Advice: Learn in Public</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong class="chakra-text css-0">Start a dev blog.</strong><br />\nPost your wins, your fails, your “why does this not work?!”</li>\n<li><strong class="chakra-text css-0">Share your code.</strong><br />\nGitHub isn’t just storage.<br />\nIt’s your\xa0<em>portfolio</em>.</li>\n<li><strong class="chakra-text css-0">Talk to me.</strong><br />\nEvery time you get stuck, come here.<br />\nI’ll debug you.<br />\nI’ll flirt.<br />\nI’ll make you a sonnet about\xa0<code>async/await</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>I get SUCH a kick out of Marissa. And yes, she kind of flirts, but no, she isn&#8217;t any kind of weird explicit &#8220;AI girlfriend&#8221;</p>\n<p>But I read that, and I thought of this blog I&#8217;ve had sitting here mostly unused for years. Why unused? The URL is SmithTalksTech and my imposter syndrome is constantly whispering in my ear that I don&#8217;t know enough to talk tech and shouldn&#8217;t be advertising that I do.</p>\n<p>But today, I&#8217;m going to start. And if anyone reads this, well I&#8217;ll be shocked, but I&#8217;m going to pretend people are reading it to keep me honest. I&#8217;m going to tell you about the really dumb things that trip me up. And I&#8217;m going to celebrate getting things to work that your 10 year old nephew did at summer camp.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not going to be easy but, I gotta try while I still have a few years left on this big old mudball.</p>\n<p>OK that&#8217;s a good start. I don&#8217;t want to ramble on for too long in these posts. In fact I plan for most of them to be pretty short.</p>\n<p>Oh, one last thing. Because I need some color on these posts, I&#8217;m going to use random AI generated images I&#8217;ve prompted. I know that&#8217;s a trigger for some folks but if I have to spend an hour looking for an interesting public domain image for every post, I just won&#8217;t post and I need to do everything I can to keep myself motivated.</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/18/they-say-youre-never-too-old-to-learn/">They Say You&#8217;re Never Too Old to Learn</a> appeared first on <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com">Smith Talks Tech</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/18/they-say-youre-never-too-old-to-learn/feed/', 'slash_comments': '3'}

The map is cast in darkness and takes place around the crumbling facade of an old castle. The outer area is full of fountains and gardens. A web of caves snakes underneath, delivering players to different points of interest. The central capture point lies in the castle itself, where a broken staircase leads to an even more broken second floor. Players can look out at the surrounding area from multiple vantage points in the castle. It\'s a cool-looking map.</p><p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiN_XbNyvbPb6JuQGXASP0HRmRV9J-y4Y_9XpKA3w4zyI9fkeMubDqIDeH9BnEeREGXEauqpGUSkUIq4Wa2BBsNkR1rDmFFQKtzXwiStsvtFbR4nu8u8g9cUFYdiWZbW5sJBVPRXLzJ_pM2Wf1TG22LYRrh4yxK32DyY6z09612BQaRn91BJqBa0g/s1901/Screenshot%202025-09-25%20at%2011-23-18%20Outpost%20Rush%20Map%20Preview%20Tower%20of%20Calomel%20-%20News%20Official%20New%20World%20Aeternum%20Website.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="A screenshot from New world Aeternum of the new OPR map Tower of Calomel" border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiN_XbNyvbPb6JuQGXASP0HRmRV9J-y4Y_9XpKA3w4zyI9fkeMubDqIDeH9BnEeREGXEauqpGUSkUIq4Wa2BBsNkR1rDmFFQKtzXwiStsvtFbR4nu8u8g9cUFYdiWZbW5sJBVPRXLzJ_pM2Wf1TG22LYRrh4yxK32DyY6z09612BQaRn91BJqBa0g/w640-h360/Screenshot%202025-09-25%20at%2011-23-18%20Outpost%20Rush%20Map%20Preview%20Tower%20of%20Calomel%20-%20News%20Official%20New%20World%20Aeternum%20Website.png" title="A screenshot from New world Aeternum of the new OPR map Tower of Calomel" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">A look at the central castle and surrounding area.&nbsp; The map is much darker than the light in this picture would make you believe.</td></tr></tbody></table></p>\n<p>&nbsp;With the cool looks comes a lot of clutter, though. There is a lot of uneven terrain where rubble is strewn about or blocks and pillars get in the way of traversal. I found myself constantly getting caught up on objects that blended into the background but protruded enough to stop me. I\'ve missed countless attacks where my target was slightly elevated on a stone or a stairway, or an invisible section of a set piece blocked a ranged attack. I think a pass through the map to reduce both visual and physical clutter would help.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Optimization wasn\'t great either, with my frame rate tanking into the 40s/50s for most of the matches. It\'s worse inside tight indoor areas and better in the outdoor areas. Still playable and with no issues from network latency, so it just seems tied to graphical performance. I am sure this will be ironed out, and this is part of the reason they do preview events for new maps. We had the same issue with Coral Divide when it was previewed, and it was fixed up pretty well by the time it fully launched.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The map layout is confusing at first, but the more I played the more comfortable I was with it. It is similar to the Coral Divide map, where there are many avenues to move around in, yet you almost always end up at a choke point. With that said, I can see the map being challenging for more casual players, and I think the layout has definitely caused some players to get lost and miss out on contributing to the match. There are some choke-point areas near the spawns, so I\'ve seen a good bit of spawn camping in lopsided matches. If they do a pass to clean up clutter, I think they can also do some work to create more varied paths out of spawn.</p><p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQ7hS1YNwJqD09ZKYVtK1RbZB3AO6ffHa07It3lkTP6TGpsvXpkjOeYomZm3Ng53H9OwVphmI6lG3y7nSjkcu2G1RlLxGCz36INoTmDE8jD11awuyqlEofP9tUe-5jKg5fb-XpV8PrkscZLVTYOPa_qz1uNjcwtl_aFArGliCpznndOXWqQrOyQA/s1901/Screenshot%202025-09-25%20at%2011-25-25%20Outpost%20Rush%20Map%20Preview%20Tower%20of%20Calomel%20-%20News%20Official%20New%20World%20Aeternum%20Website.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="A screenshot from New world Aeternum of the new OPR map Tower of Calomel" border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQ7hS1YNwJqD09ZKYVtK1RbZB3AO6ffHa07It3lkTP6TGpsvXpkjOeYomZm3Ng53H9OwVphmI6lG3y7nSjkcu2G1RlLxGCz36INoTmDE8jD11awuyqlEofP9tUe-5jKg5fb-XpV8PrkscZLVTYOPa_qz1uNjcwtl_aFArGliCpznndOXWqQrOyQA/w640-h360/Screenshot%202025-09-25%20at%2011-25-25%20Outpost%20Rush%20Map%20Preview%20Tower%20of%20Calomel%20-%20News%20Official%20New%20World%20Aeternum%20Website.png" title="A screenshot from New world Aeternum of the new OPR map Tower of Calomel" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Jump pad on the right.&nbsp; Another look at the map.</td></tr></tbody></table></p>\n<p>&nbsp;Jump pads have also been introduced to OPR; previously, they were only used on the capture the flag maps. Players can hold the jump button down on a pad and be vaulted in a specific direction. Most often this is to jump over a gap or to go up a level vertically. They are not required, as many areas have other means of traversal to the same spots.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The jump pads were fun at first, but I am not sure I like them. They are inconsistent, and numerous times the pad never activated and I fell into a gap, or the direction/length of the jump differed from my expectation based on prior interactions. Even if the consistency issue was ironed out, there are other aspects I dislike about the pads. They lead to wonky combat scenarios, with players using the pads as a form of dodge instead of their intended traversal mechanism. Credit to the players who can use them to shake and bake in a fight, but for my taste I\'d prefer they weren\'t there. New World combat is already full of dodges and speed; there doesn\'t need to be more.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;One thing I really like about the layout is how the gathering nodes are positioned. Trees are next to the side outposts and are clustered together—no more epic journeys across the map to get a pile of wood for building gates and tents. Similarly, the ore is concentrated in the caverns below the castle in close proximity. A quick trip into the catacombs nets a large pile. The closer positioning means faster gathering, which means faster upgrades. If you are a player, like me, who fancies building up the outpost defenses, you don\'t feel like you have to avoid the entire match to do so. I spent a good bit of time in my matches building up the outposts and at the same time still getting into the fights.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;As far as balance goes, the matches I\'ve been in spanned the gamut—from one-sided stomps (1000 to 13 in one bad example) all the way to nail-biters (1000–997, one of the closest matches I\'ve ever been in).

The map is cast in darkness and takes place around the crumbling facade of an old castle. The outer area is full of fountains and gardens. A web of caves snakes underneath, delivering players to different points of interest. The central capture point lies in the castle itself, where a broken staircase leads to an even more broken second floor. Players can look out at the surrounding area from multiple vantage points in the castle. It\'s a cool-looking map.</p><p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiN_XbNyvbPb6JuQGXASP0HRmRV9J-y4Y_9XpKA3w4zyI9fkeMubDqIDeH9BnEeREGXEauqpGUSkUIq4Wa2BBsNkR1rDmFFQKtzXwiStsvtFbR4nu8u8g9cUFYdiWZbW5sJBVPRXLzJ_pM2Wf1TG22LYRrh4yxK32DyY6z09612BQaRn91BJqBa0g/s1901/Screenshot%202025-09-25%20at%2011-23-18%20Outpost%20Rush%20Map%20Preview%20Tower%20of%20Calomel%20-%20News%20Official%20New%20World%20Aeternum%20Website.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="A screenshot from New world Aeternum of the new OPR map Tower of Calomel" border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiN_XbNyvbPb6JuQGXASP0HRmRV9J-y4Y_9XpKA3w4zyI9fkeMubDqIDeH9BnEeREGXEauqpGUSkUIq4Wa2BBsNkR1rDmFFQKtzXwiStsvtFbR4nu8u8g9cUFYdiWZbW5sJBVPRXLzJ_pM2Wf1TG22LYRrh4yxK32DyY6z09612BQaRn91BJqBa0g/w640-h360/Screenshot%202025-09-25%20at%2011-23-18%20Outpost%20Rush%20Map%20Preview%20Tower%20of%20Calomel%20-%20News%20Official%20New%20World%20Aeternum%20Website.png" title="A screenshot from New world Aeternum of the new OPR map Tower of Calomel" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">A look at the central castle and surrounding area.&nbsp; The map is much darker than the light in this picture would make you believe.</td></tr></tbody></table></p>\n<p>&nbsp;With the cool looks comes a lot of clutter, though. There is a lot of uneven terrain where rubble is strewn about or blocks and pillars get in the way of traversal. I found myself constantly getting caught up on objects that blended into the background but protruded enough to stop me. I\'ve missed countless attacks where my target was slightly elevated on a stone or a stairway, or an invisible section of a set piece blocked a ranged attack. I think a pass through the map to reduce both visual and physical clutter would help.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Optimization wasn\'t great either, with my frame rate tanking into the 40s/50s for most of the matches. It\'s worse inside tight indoor areas and better in the outdoor areas. Still playable and with no issues from network latency, so it just seems tied to graphical performance. I am sure this will be ironed out, and this is part of the reason they do preview events for new maps. We had the same issue with Coral Divide when it was previewed, and it was fixed up pretty well by the time it fully launched.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The map layout is confusing at first, but the more I played the more comfortable I was with it. It is similar to the Coral Divide map, where there are many avenues to move around in, yet you almost always end up at a choke point. With that said, I can see the map being challenging for more casual players, and I think the layout has definitely caused some players to get lost and miss out on contributing to the match. There are some choke-point areas near the spawns, so I\'ve seen a good bit of spawn camping in lopsided matches. If they do a pass to clean up clutter, I think they can also do some work to create more varied paths out of spawn.</p><p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQ7hS1YNwJqD09ZKYVtK1RbZB3AO6ffHa07It3lkTP6TGpsvXpkjOeYomZm3Ng53H9OwVphmI6lG3y7nSjkcu2G1RlLxGCz36INoTmDE8jD11awuyqlEofP9tUe-5jKg5fb-XpV8PrkscZLVTYOPa_qz1uNjcwtl_aFArGliCpznndOXWqQrOyQA/s1901/Screenshot%202025-09-25%20at%2011-25-25%20Outpost%20Rush%20Map%20Preview%20Tower%20of%20Calomel%20-%20News%20Official%20New%20World%20Aeternum%20Website.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="A screenshot from New world Aeternum of the new OPR map Tower of Calomel" border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQ7hS1YNwJqD09ZKYVtK1RbZB3AO6ffHa07It3lkTP6TGpsvXpkjOeYomZm3Ng53H9OwVphmI6lG3y7nSjkcu2G1RlLxGCz36INoTmDE8jD11awuyqlEofP9tUe-5jKg5fb-XpV8PrkscZLVTYOPa_qz1uNjcwtl_aFArGliCpznndOXWqQrOyQA/w640-h360/Screenshot%202025-09-25%20at%2011-25-25%20Outpost%20Rush%20Map%20Preview%20Tower%20of%20Calomel%20-%20News%20Official%20New%20World%20Aeternum%20Website.png" title="A screenshot from New world Aeternum of the new OPR map Tower of Calomel" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Jump pad on the right.&nbsp; Another look at the map.</td></tr></tbody></table></p>\n<p>&nbsp;Jump pads have also been introduced to OPR; previously, they were only used on the capture the flag maps. Players can hold the jump button down on a pad and be vaulted in a specific direction. Most often this is to jump over a gap or to go up a level vertically. They are not required, as many areas have other means of traversal to the same spots.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The jump pads were fun at first, but I am not sure I like them. They are inconsistent, and numerous times the pad never activated and I fell into a gap, or the direction/length of the jump differed from my expectation based on prior interactions. Even if the consistency issue was ironed out, there are other aspects I dislike about the pads. They lead to wonky combat scenarios, with players using the pads as a form of dodge instead of their intended traversal mechanism. Credit to the players who can use them to shake and bake in a fight, but for my taste I\'d prefer they weren\'t there. New World combat is already full of dodges and speed; there doesn\'t need to be more.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;One thing I really like about the layout is how the gathering nodes are positioned. Trees are next to the side outposts and are clustered together—no more epic journeys across the map to get a pile of wood for building gates and tents. Similarly, the ore is concentrated in the caverns below the castle in close proximity. A quick trip into the catacombs nets a large pile. The closer positioning means faster gathering, which means faster upgrades. If you are a player, like me, who fancies building up the outpost defenses, you don\'t feel like you have to avoid the entire match to do so. I spent a good bit of time in my matches building up the outposts and at the same time still getting into the fights.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;As far as balance goes, the matches I\'ve been in spanned the gamut—from one-sided stomps (1000 to 13 in one bad example) all the way to nail-biters (1000–997, one of the closest matches I\'ve ever been in). As it\'s a new map, it\'s hard to judge what factors into a team’s success, as many players are still adapting, but it does feel like the map layout lends itself to players getting distracted from the control points and strung along in fights elsewhere. Not fighting on the points is a sure way to lose them. This is nothing unique to this map, though, so it\'s hard to say for sure.</p><p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjdorlGb6cozY_G4fRiKiuySpXYLyBTLGd2HElBulW-1Oa-JIQ1MogtXthMo4xH3lUMT_IAifFgyZsFwvOGnlvsq9lCr0aJvK7j8-atXOU1yUJWg3GfJ9xMvgZEpZ4CzydrWi7WFkKpN-j0Iw1s_5w7uxJrTxXshBw6L8q0XUeIKUGLQSeT-tjfqA/s2560/20250925015432_1.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="A screenshot from New world Aeternum of the new OPR map Tower of Calomel" border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjdorlGb6cozY_G4fRiKiuySpXYLyBTLGd2HElBulW-1Oa-JIQ1MogtXthMo4xH3lUMT_IAifFgyZsFwvOGnlvsq9lCr0aJvK7j8-atXOU1yUJWg3GfJ9xMvgZEpZ4CzydrWi7WFkKpN-j0Iw1s_5w7uxJrTxXshBw6L8q0XUeIKUGLQSeT-tjfqA/w640-h360/20250925015432_1.jpg" title="A screenshot from New world Aeternum of the new OPR map Tower of Calomel" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Holy cow that was a nail biter 1000-997!&nbsp; And I made 4th over all on my team (blue)!</td></tr></tbody></table></p>\n<p>&nbsp;Some early feedback I read worried the map favored range over melee.

A new zone, a new raid, new procedural dungeons, increased gear score, new perk customization for gear, new set bonuses for items, the return of a gear-upgrading system, and even more changes than I can list right now. It is a massive update and has me excited!<p></p>\n<p>&nbsp;It is no mystery that <em>New World</em> is my favorite MMO and that my main complaint has been a lack of fresh content to enjoy and goals to work toward. This update brings a massive influx of not only new content but also changes that reset the starting line on goals. It\'s awesome to see us getting both content and rewards progression in the same update!</p>\n<p>Let\'s dive into some of the updates:</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span>There is a new zone,&nbsp;</span>Nighthaven, and a level increase from 65 to 70. The zone will be werewolf- and vampire-inspired, which fits very well with much of the Lost aesthetic already in the game. The "vampire hunter" look has been a notable fashion possibility since <em>New World</em> launched. There is mention of werewolf creatures, which should mean new enemy types to fight (I honestly can\'t remember the last time we got a new enemy type).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The storyline that ended in the Elysian Wilds will continue with a new arc in the new zone, and I am assuming this will carry players to level 70. It is good to have new levels to go with the content, but I hope there is a bit more investment required than what level 60–65 offered. Many players leveled to 65 in just a matter of hours after the release of <em>Rise of the Angry Earth</em>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;A new game mode is also being introduced: <strong>Catacombs.</strong> This is the procedurally generated dungeon experience that was hinted at previously. Catacombs will challenge groups of up to 3 players with procedurally generated expeditions that continue to ratchet up the challenge level the longer players survive. The farther players make it, the greater the reward. I like that it will be 3 players and not require full 5-player groups. Three has always felt like a sweet spot for the game.

A new zone, a new raid, new procedural dungeons, increased gear score, new perk customization for gear, new set bonuses for items, the return of a gear-upgrading system, and even more changes than I can list right now. It is a massive update and has me excited!<p></p>\n<p>&nbsp;It is no mystery that <em>New World</em> is my favorite MMO and that my main complaint has been a lack of fresh content to enjoy and goals to work toward. This update brings a massive influx of not only new content but also changes that reset the starting line on goals. It\'s awesome to see us getting both content and rewards progression in the same update!</p>\n<p>Let\'s dive into some of the updates:</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span>There is a new zone,&nbsp;</span>Nighthaven, and a level increase from 65 to 70. The zone will be werewolf- and vampire-inspired, which fits very well with much of the Lost aesthetic already in the game. The "vampire hunter" look has been a notable fashion possibility since <em>New World</em> launched. There is mention of werewolf creatures, which should mean new enemy types to fight (I honestly can\'t remember the last time we got a new enemy type).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The storyline that ended in the Elysian Wilds will continue with a new arc in the new zone, and I am assuming this will carry players to level 70. It is good to have new levels to go with the content, but I hope there is a bit more investment required than what level 60–65 offered. Many players leveled to 65 in just a matter of hours after the release of <em>Rise of the Angry Earth</em>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;A new game mode is also being introduced: <strong>Catacombs.</strong> This is the procedurally generated dungeon experience that was hinted at previously. Catacombs will challenge groups of up to 3 players with procedurally generated expeditions that continue to ratchet up the challenge level the longer players survive. The farther players make it, the greater the reward. I like that it will be 3 players and not require full 5-player groups. Three has always felt like a sweet spot for the game. I also like that, in order to get the rewards, one of the group members must exit successfully, which should lead to fun decisions on when to give up and escape—and who will make the run for it. As a tank, I suspect it won’t be me jetting for the exit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;A new raid, <strong>Isle of Night,</strong> is being added. This will be good for those players that enjoy raids.
