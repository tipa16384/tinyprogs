Thanks to @caffo for the inspiration. He posted up a picture that said "For the first time in my life I was happy. Then I realized it was all the caffeine," with a dozen cups of coffee. So I was going to have the AiM crew do a podcast, where they spent most of the time talking about their cups of coffee while completely ignoring the Monopoly game going on all around them... and it kind of grew from there.

"Skater Gnome" is a reference to the famous EverQuest story teller, whose [adventures in EverQuest with his level 5 monk](http://wiki.dreamers-nightmares.com/index.php/Skater_Gnome) are a must read.
