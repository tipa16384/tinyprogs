# Spellborn Gallery

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-01-04 01:37:46*

I took a lot of pictures while adventuring in Spellborn. I intended to make a huge gallery post, but did a comic instead. You can see all the (decent) photos I took by visiting my [Spellborn Gallery](http://picasaweb.google.com/brendahol/SpellbornGallery). Each screen shot has a caption explaining where it was taken and other interesting info. If you really want to get a feel for what the world of the Enclave looks like, [check it out](http://picasaweb.google.com/brendahol/SpellbornGallery).

Also, the shadows don't always appear to be in the right direction, like the point-lights are being ignored in favor of the ambient light source. Could be a great game, but the graphics are only mediocre in my opinion.

Also, they drop to low poly character models pretty quickly. There's bunches of issues and I imagine they have a lot of polishing and tuning ahead of them. It's still a really pretty game, though.
