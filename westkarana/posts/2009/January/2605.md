# Wizard 101: Take THIS, Thomas!

Thomas Lionblood has been having a [bunch of fun](http://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2009/01/tres-de-smarmy.html), [bringing magical artifacts](http://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2009/01/smarmy-part-duex.html) [infused with Death power](http://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2009/01/terminus.html) to the verdant green of the Life school.

We Life wizards will no longer put up with this blatant disregard for the power of Life.

So here I am with my new Life staff standing in front of, oh my, is this the Death school?

I get a HUGE bonus, fighting against Death users. HUGE. MASSIVE.

Come on out to play, Thomas dear, won't you?

Half a bubble from level 48. Ballpark guess, I think I'm about halfway through Dragonspyre, based on the number of books I have found.

I don't get to play with Tipa much because she's way ahead of me but I love reading where she is and knowing what awaits me. I'm probably 50% through Mooshu and in no particular hurry. DS just came out so I'm not expecting them to release another zone any time soon. I'm taking my time. I don't think I'm going to take the time to farm anything until I hit DS. Doesn't seem to make sense at this point. 

Great staff! I wish Balance had a real school in Ravenwood. Death players probably wish that too. I feel left out not having the towers to meet up with your like spec'd school mates. *sheds a tear*
