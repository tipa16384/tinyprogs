Hey we're gonna quickly run, quickly run
From the entrance to your lair, Nexona
Have us a bit of scaly fun, scaly fun
We're coming so beware, Nexona
Buff 'em up, get a coup- ple of mana sticks
Swap your gear, stand right here, sing arcane resists
My, aye, aye, aye, aye Woo!
Ma ma ma my Nexona
Ma ma ma my Nexona

In a cubby, lizard sacrifice, tastes real nice,
give you a little bit of heal, Nexona
if we hadn't paid the price, killed them twice
made you go without a meal, Nexona
Shiny in the hall, comes the call, and we deal with it
Now a drake which is take- ing the raid with it
Damn, damn, damn, damn damn Noo!
Ma ma ma my Nexona
Ma ma ma my Nexona

And yep, that's me ear-wormed with that song too now.

My CE nostalgia has grown lately as I am move through almost 1GB of screenshots, most of which I took climbing through the Luclin-DoD progression.

I wasn't able to save the original message board, it just got too funky what with the host being some bizarre throwback to the paleolithic and I just couldn't figure out what was behind the authorization troubles. But my original songs and all the long years of Crimson Eternity's history are safe.

I do hope the CE folks are doing well now in World of Warcraft, but since I could no longer log in to the site myself, I eventually stopped trying to read about their adventures. I think there's lots of WoW-specific hosting sites that would be a far better fit, anyway.

Failed :(

Grats on the mythical, troubs with shiny weapons are an endangered species, you know!
