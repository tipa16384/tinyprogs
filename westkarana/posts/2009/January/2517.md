# Wizard 101: Wanna wanna, wanna wanna dance?

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-01-04 10:03:52*

Stingite over at the amazingly wonderful Wizard 101 blog, [The Friendly Necromancer](http://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/), has [made an INCREDIBLE dance video](http://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2009/01/katzensteins-lab-dance-floor.html) from Katzenstein's Lab. Makes me want to run right there and invite some friends for a party of my own :)
