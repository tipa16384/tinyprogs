# Wizard101: Is that a crafting station or an ATM?

I pretty much gave up on crafting when I received the first Dragonspyre crafting quest and realized how many hours of gathering I would have to do. More than I wanted, and if Malistaire had once needed some special high-level crafted item to fall in defeat, his re-nerfing meant he needed that no longer, so I let it lie for awhile.

Tonight, I thought that my balance wizard's outfit had gotten a little tattered; it was time for a new one. Why not craft some?

Allison is my rich character, with nearly 60,000 gold. She bought the necessary Scorpion treasure cards from the Library and passed them over. I chose recipes from the Marleybone vendor that looked good and mostly used harvests I already had. I picked up the rest from the Bazaar for between 15 and 30 gold each, bought the gems and glass vials from the vendor outside Digmore Station, and went back to my estate to do the crafting.

11 hour cooldowns on crafting, but I have three slots available so, no problem. The clothing was made in an instant, and the cooldown timers started their long countdown.

How to get it from Tara to Allison? There is no item trading, after all, so it was another trip to the Bazaar.

The items sold to the Bazaar for between 3500 and 4500 gold, and were immediately bought by Allison for between 9000 and 15000 gold (or thereabouts).

I ended up making about 5000 gold profit on Tara. The clothes were hideously awfully expensive to buy on Allison's account, easily the most expensive things you could buy.

HOWEVER -- nobody says I have to buy the stuff with another character when I sell it. If I can make 7500 gold every 11 hours just making and selling Marleybone gear, how much could I make selling Mooshu gear?

Also -- beware -- crafting this equipment advanced my Dragonspyre crafting quest incorrectly. That quest may now be impossible to complete, since I won't have the items it requires at the end. I'll let you (and KingsIsle) know next time I do crafting. It's clearly a bug, but is it also an exploit?

Oh yeah -- the "Buy" price in the Bazaar is incorrect where listed below the dressing room view. It is correct in the Bazaar listing.

*Edit: I made three additional hats to sale. The crafting quest advanced to the end, but I was not able to turn it in without the rings, which I still need to make. So this is a bug, but not an exploit.
