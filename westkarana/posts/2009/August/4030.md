There were so many people at the Second "Back to School" Meet-and-Greet thrown by the bloggers at Evil Theurgists and Diary of a Wizard that you could hardly hear people begging for dates and treasure cards!

I was thrilled to meet so many new friends and fill up my friend list a little :) It was a lot of fun! Afterward we went and let Jade Oni know exactly HOW to play a Life Wizard ... in STEREO!
