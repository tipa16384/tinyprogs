# The time is now...

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-02-13 09:26:54*

Today the Unix time stamp hits 1234567890. Today, all Unix/Linux geeks around the world are writing scripts like this one:

`import time`

`while time.time() < 1234567890.0:
   time.sleep(0.25)`

`print "The time is",time.time(),"!"`

Seriously. Gotta do it.

## Comments!

`#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>`

`struct timeval tv;
main() {
  do {
    (void)usleep(250);
    (void)gettimeofday(&tv, NULL);
  } until (tv.tv_sec >= 0x49999999);`

  `printf("The time is 0x%x", tv.tv_sec);
}`

And yes, in addition to being a geek, I'm old. 3000 years old, in fact. But my hair is still fabulous.

Anyway, that script was old, old, old. I've moved way beyond that now. I laugh at the person I was back then -- HAH! Here's the current script:

`import time, os`

`curtime = 0
partytime = 1234567890.0`

`while time.time() < partytime:
  if time.time() - curtime > 1000.0:
    curtime = time.time()
    delta = partytime-curtime
    if delta < 60.0:
      s = '%d seconds' % (round(delta))
    elif delta < 3600.0:
      s = '%d minutes' % (round(delta/60))
    else:
      h = int(delta/3600.0)
      m = round((delta-h*3600.0)/60.0)
      s = '%d hours and %d minutes' % (h,m)
    print "The current time is %d. %s until The Time." % (round(curtime),s)
  time.sleep(0.25)`

`print "The Special Time has arrived! The time is %f!" % time.time()`

`os.system('curl -u TipaDaKnife:xxxxx -d status="Rejoice, the Unix system time is now: %f." http://twitter.com/statuses/update.json' % time.time())`
