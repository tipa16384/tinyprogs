# Adventures in Monopoly #4: Revenge

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-02-06 08:18:27*

The story thus far: After an attempted coup that leaves him imprisoned, Bear escapes and rounds up a gang of ne'er-do-well tokens and takes over the entire board in a legendary crime wave that leaves trusting and lovable Scottie dead. Scottie's friends Car and Hat, following their friend's wishes, took his body to Germany and buried it in Frei Parken and said a mysterious, ancient Latin prayer over his body. When night fell, Scottie rose from his grave, darker, evil, thinking only of revenge.

Meanwhile, Bear tried to entice new tokens to play Monopoly, on a board under his nearly complete control, with hotels from Mediterranean to Marvin Gardens. Unfortunately for him, he was forced to mortgage the properties on the fourth side of the board to pay for the others.
