# Don't bring a knife to a HAMMER fight, Jack Sparrow!

This will go down in history as the day when Scottie Dog defeated Captain Jack Sparrow.

In My Brute, anyway. (PS -- click here to roll up a Brute and [become one of A Dire Bear's pupils](http://a-dire-bear.mybrute.com)).

Finally got to level 10 with A Dire Bear, btw, and made a new clan, [Clan Nostalgia the Clan](http://mybrute.com/team/47928). So that's ANOTHER game we're in :)

Click on the following link http://uuut6.mybrute.com/, generate a brute and fight against me.

Level your brute up to level 3 as that is the first chance you will get a pet.

From there you have a 30% chance of getting a bear every time you level!

Good luck and enjoy!
