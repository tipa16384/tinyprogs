# Wizard 101's "Extended Downtime" -- Grizzleheim on Test?

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-06-16 19:56:12*

Re: this message from Wizard 101, the extended downtime might possibly have something to do with pushing Grizzleheim to the test server, but who knows?


> Wizard101 Extended Maintenance

Wizard101 the game will be offline for maintenance for an extended period of time. 

From 3am to 7am Central US time, on June 17 2009, Wizard101 the game will be offline. 

Players will not be able to log in. Players who are logged in at that time will be prompted to log out. 

Please note, this downtime is only for technical maintenance, nothing is being added to or changed in the game during this period. 

Thank you for your understanding, while we continue to improve the game for everyone.
