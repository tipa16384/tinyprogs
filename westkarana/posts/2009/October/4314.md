# Wizard101: The Clockwork Spider DOES exist! And it's MINE!

Fourth time through the Master/Hard tower, the big baddy drops the Spider Golem, which would be the yellow character there.

WOOT! I now have one of the rarest pets in the game!

NOW what do I do with my life?

Well, I went back to taking Marissa and Allison through Marleybone... Working on Knight's Court now. I can feel the wonderfulness of Katzenstein's Lab coming closer and closer... and then I'll go back to Grizzleheim, I promise. But I have to go see Doc Katz first!

I'll help with Counterweight East any time! I love that area!

Definitely a pet worth slaving for, though.

**yunk** writes: I peeked in there, kept seeing 4 guys attack me. People would jump in and start the tower with me then flee after a fight started. I haven't tried it since.

Isn't Call of Cthulu the game where you are always rolling up a new character because they never last more than on session? :) Actually I thought I heard there is a World of Darkness MMO coming, I think CCP is making it. Not sure it really counts as horror, or if it will be more like Twilight.

**[Tesh](http://tishtoshtesh.wordpress.com/)** writes: The hard tower where the Death school used to be, right? I've been through it four times now, and all I keep getting are robes and hats I can't use and other assorted stuff that's weaker than my gear (a middling level 33 in Marleybone old Crown gear... admittedly good stuff).

I wouldn't try to solo the tower, but packing along my level 17 Myth alt makes for a nice duo to take down the tower without much fuss. So long as nobody jumps in and screws up the whole sneaky "spawn two baddies *then* have the alt jump in" trick, anyway.

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: Well, if you see me online at any time (Tara Mythcrafter, Allison Goldtalon, Marissa Spiritcaller), I'd love to help!

**BlazeDreamCoin** writes: I'm a necromancer that wears a black and white Martreys Hat, vestment of adverse, martreys boots, and a blood bat.I mostly teleport if you see me.

**BlazeDreamCoin** writes: I'm a mystery player so you probably won't see me.

**AmberStargem** writes: Good job! I know how much you wanted that! Now just to get me my own.....

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: If you see me on, I'm more than happy to help!

**AmberStargem** writes: I'll do that! But I'm only friends with Tara Mythcrafter if thats ok! Thanks!

**carson** writes: we could meet in Mooshu.If anybody likes defeating the Jade Oni,its tons of fun.You could most likely see me in the more crowded realms during 3:00-8:00 central time.Remember I said my name and level earlier!
