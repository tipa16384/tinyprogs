Want to know the worst thing about Halloween in Wizard City?

Everyone wants to come as a witch.

I've been trundling through the Master Tower, looking for that elusive Clockwork Spider, but no sign of it. I've gotten a wraith statue and a bunch of dead trees, though, so I guess that counts for something.

Makes for a really nice Halloween tableaux, anyway.... :)
