Inspired by [Spink's comments on Monopoly's "house rules"](http://spinksville.wordpress.com/2009/05/06/youre-playing-it-wrong/). I mean, you can't mention Monopoly without Bear and the gang chiming in...

Seriously though, I love this one. Those are the most inventive house rules I've ever heard. The only house rules we ever had were "let Lacey (my stepsister) win because she'll throw a fit if you doesn't."
