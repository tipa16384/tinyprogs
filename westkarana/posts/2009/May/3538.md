Somewhere in the Field of Bone, a Burynai is trying to explain to her husband why their daughter looks like an elf.

Now my old computer is another story. When Stargrace at MMOQuests got a new video card, she went with ATI instead of the nVidia most of us have been using since EQ pushed it so strongly. And EQ2 looks amazing with ATI -- it looks like that, WAY better than nVidia. So, I'm a convert.
