We've word from Ravenwood that the newly-named Builder Turtles are being dropped off at their new homes across the Spiral, and that tomorrow, we'll be able to buy and furnish our own homes. Thomes the Friendly Necromancer has been [finding lots of treasures everywhere](http://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/search/label/House%20Item%20of%20the%20Day), and I've gotten a good look at [all ten of the currently available homes](../../../index.php/2009/04/26/wizard-101-all-ten-player-houses/) ([and a closer look at a couple](../../../index.php/2009/04/23/wizard-101-player-housing-on-test/)).

Check out the complete information on player housing in [the May newsletter](https://www.wizard101.com/site/home2/wizard101/page_8ad6a4042100700b01211200afe1031f).


> Wizard101 will be offline Wednesday May 06 2009 starting at 3:00am Central US time until approximately 8:00am Central US time.
Wizard101 will be offline for an extended period of time tonight so we can implement the much anticipated Castles & Lands housing feature, voiceovers for Marleybone, MooShu and Dragonspyre, and many other exciting updates.

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: Stormzilla? I think that's for sale in Moo Shu.

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: I'm not sure why you chose to post your account and password here (I removed them), but I don't want your information, and you should never EVER post it anywhere, especially your password. You're just asking to have your account stolen if you do that. If anyone ever asks for your password, they are trying to scam you.

**frog master** writes: please answer my question!!!!= :)

---

**carson** writes: sorry frog master, but I have the same problem.

---

**[mariah](http://donthaveone)** writes: how do you get the the flamezilla pet and those cool dragons in wizards?

---

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: The Flamezilla pet was from a Wizard101 card I bought at Best Buy. Dragons come from various places -- the pet store in Wizard City sells some.

---

**carson** writes: yeah i did that too

**frog master** writes: How do you get a krokotillion pet that has the card?

---

**necromancer** writes: where and how long does it take to defeat Malistare?

---

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: Malistaire is in the Grand Spire off of Dragonspyre Academy, and it takes about two hours to do his instance start to finish, though you can skip a good portion of it if you want to just get to the final fight. It's best to have a full group, but you can do it with as few as two characters, but don't expect that to be easy.

---

**carson** writes: about what level do you get to face him?

---

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: You'll reach the point in your questing to defeat Malistaire between 47 and 50, but many wizards hitch a ride with friends and face him much earlier. My balance wizard alt has been part of the group since her 20s :)

**carson** writes: thats good for you.My level 37 is about to complete Mooshu,so I want to know everything about Dragonspyre.Thanks!
