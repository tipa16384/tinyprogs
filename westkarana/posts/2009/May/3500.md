Sean Emeraldweaver, a Wizard101 blogger from Alaska, wanted me to show his video advertisement for his blog, [Automagic](http://auto-magic.blogspot.com/). Hey, I'm proud to write for Sean's second favorite blog ;) It's wonderful to see so many new W101 bloggers. The game definitely deserves more press!
