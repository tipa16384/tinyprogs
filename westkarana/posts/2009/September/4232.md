# Earth Eternal: Tallgrass Farm

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-09-25 19:16:08*

Sparkplay Community Manager Andrew Sipotz was kind enough to send along this fantastic image of a scene from their forthcoming anthro MMO, [Earth Eternal](http://www.eartheternal.com/). More about the game when the NDA drops :) Maybe if this one works out, they'll do an [Albedo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo_Anthropomorphics) expansion?

Of all the MMOs due to release between now and next summer, this is the only one I already know I will be playing.
