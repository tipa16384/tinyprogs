# City of Villains: A Villain's Tale

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-03-17 01:34:49*

I was teleporting around Cap du Diablo and this story came to me, pretty much exactly as it is here. Sometimes they just come like that, fully formed, and then it's just a matter of putting the pieces together.

Enjoy :)

Think I'll go visit my CoH/V toons for a bit this afternoon and see if I have any better luck than Sunday at getting used to the game again after waaaay too much time away.

Poor toons, couple have been offline for 2000+ days

Of course, I feel out of touch now for not knowing about Tron 2, hehe. Bruce Boxleitner needs more movie roles!

Tron 2 will definitely be something I will go and see, but at the same time I think it may be difficult to do a good sequel in the same spirit that made the original one a cult classic.
