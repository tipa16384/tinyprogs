# Acclaim Bonus Coin Weekend April 24-26

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-04-24 16:51:58*

If [Tycho](../../../index.php/2009/04/24/web-log-424-friday-is-free-day-edition/comment-page-1/#comment-13592) didn't put you off with his description of Acclaim's Coin-based subscription plan for the Chronicles of Spellborn, this weekend it is slightly cheaper to buy the Coins if you buy in bulk, as the bonus Coins given for bulk purchases are doubled this weekend!

You can potentially get nine months of Spellborn for $8.89/month... if you [do the math](../../../index.php/2009/03/20/spellborn-on-the-cheap-new-armors-dev-chat/)!
