# Meet the Press vs Cradle of Filth

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-04-21 23:18:39*

I can't write about the betas I am playing, so... more comics! Pictures from some Meet the Press I found on YouTube. Dialog from the [Wikipedia discussion page for Cradle of Filth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cradle_of_Filth).

Well, I do agree that CoF aren't very brutal :P

Metal subgenres and sub-sub-subgenres are always a great source for ridiculous flamewars. I once made a [misheard lyrics video for Amon Amarth's Fury Divine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg2BekIwkDg) and got flamed for calling them viking metal.

Creepy.
