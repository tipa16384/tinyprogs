You can talk about it now! Expect an article about it for tomorrow, but if you've been playing -- how did you like it?

Oh thank the maker! 

Now I guess I better write something about it too, huh?

**Rocknrollchicken** writes: I loved the game. Having 2 kids that are 7, and a 9 year old who play W101, this game will have so much more to do. The chance to play many careers, and not stick to just one will keep them from getting bored. From someone who has been with Sony from the beginning, this is a good one from them.
