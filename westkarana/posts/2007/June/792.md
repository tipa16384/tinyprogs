# SOE Publishes Pirates

*Posted by Tipa on 2007-06-26 12:42:57*

[In the news](http://kotaku.com/gaming/scurvy-dogs/pirates-of-the-burning-sea-signs-with-soe-271797.php) this morning, SOE will publish "Pirates of the Burning Sea". This isn't really a shock, since PotBS didn't have a publisher and SOE has shown themselves open to making publishing deals ("Vanguard: Saga of Heroes", "Gods & Heroes: Rome Rising") and really, where are they going to go? Blizzard? EA? NCSoft? Of them all, NCSoft would likely have been the best second choice.

The real question is, will SOE's (undeservedly, imo) bad reputation taint PotBS's launch? And down the road, will we see Flying Labs Software folded into SOE, as Sigil was? If PotBS is the success many think it will be, I doubt SOE will settle for a taste when it could have the whole pie.
