# Comment Spam

*Posted by Tipa on 2007-06-20 11:31:38*

The [Ancient Gaming Noob](http://tagn.wordpress.com/2007/06/19/complimentary-comment-spam/) had an interesting post today about the spam comments he gets in his blog. I've often complimented him before on how his well-designed site has changed my life, caused me to burst into laughter unexpectedly and inspired me to become a better person -- many of my heartfelt comments, he displayed there for everyone to see.

Well. Here at West Karana, we get spam. Most of it gets captured and shunted off by Akismet, and what remains doesn't get past the filter that cuts off comments to older entries. But, we do get some spam. Here's some highlights of what is being held by Akismet right now.

 * Tipa. I just found your friggin laptop in your car. Yeah. And your little "story". Writing stories about killing people in real life is against the law, bitch. Sue said she hadÂ your address. Expect a letter from my lawyer.

I still get the random spam now and again. I'm thinking of allowing some back in because they were pretty fun sometimes!
