# Skating Away...

Well, my last concert trip didn't turn out so well. Blue Oyster Cult was a real disappointment, a dead band. Will Jethro Tull be the same?

I can't **not** go. I spent five years learning to play flute like Ian Anderson, yet I've never seen him in concert. He used to show up occasionally at the Flute World expo, but I never got around to going to any of those. I played Bouree at one of my flute recitals (but the piano accompanist balked at doing the bass solo I had so carefully transcribed).Â  Anderson's technique led me to such greats as [Roland Kirk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahsaan_Roland_Kirk) and [Paul Hindemith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindemith). Anderson's solo album [Divinities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divinities:_Twelve_Dances_with_G) was on perma rotation on my car's CD player.

So I love the man and his music so much, I can only be disappointed.

Still, I can't NOT go. Dec 1, Wallingford, CT, look me up. I'll be in the balcony.

Compared to the other four times I saw them... this time they were just in it for a paycheck.
