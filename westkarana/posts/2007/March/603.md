# Almost back

*Posted by Tipa on 2007-03-25 06:46:53*

I started a new job in Connecticut, which involved a cross-country move and a snowstorm... my computers get here today, Internet by Thursday, so soon i'll be back gaming.

I haven't yet been desperate enough to play a MMO -- any MMO -- that I buy a WoW time card and a few hours of play at the Gaming Cafe in the local mall. It's nice to have that option. It's a great mall -- they have that LAN Cafe filled with gaming PCs and Xboxes, two games stores, and even a Games Workshop store for tabletop gamers.

This time without Internet would have been filled with more games if I hadn't boxed all the disks for my offline games for shipping... I really thought I'd get my stuff a week ago... so instead of playing Oblivion, Dungeon Siege 2, Star Trek Armada 2 or NWN, I've been playing Rag Doll Kung Fu (which is kooky but not as much fun as I thought it would be) and Windows 3D Pinball.

Tonight though... going to start with a little Guitar Hero 2 and then sit down for a nice bit of adventure and political intrigue with Final Fantasy 12...

On your comment on my blog, ya i've done those quest.. (i'm a total quest whore). But at the higher level there just some point where you run out of quest you really really have to grind a level or 2 so you can do the higher level quest. And that the part of the game that really kills it for me.
