Idol Final 6 predictions: Lakisha and Phil in the bottom 2, Lakisha to go home. Jordin and Chris won the night, with Blake and Melinda in the middle.
## Comments!

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: All the contestants were "safe" this week. Next week, two will be voted off based on their combined votes for the two weeks. Jordin, apparent TCO* for the season, was led to believe she'd be booted and totally lost it... how cruel... and then she had to immediately stand up and sing.

* TCO = The Chosen One. Each season the producers pick the person they want to win and the judges go out of their way to influence the votes in TCO's favor. This year, it seems to be Jordin.
