# Those lazy fire faeries...

So, my Neopet, Spitefur the Xweetok, was running around doing all his morning chores, when while at the Shrine of Colzac, a fire faerie appeared and demanded Spitefur find her scarf.

Come ON! She's a FIRE FAERIE! What the heck does she need a scarf for? Sheesh.

And even worse, the Shrine gave me nothing today.

I think it's burned out.

I blame the faerie.

My favorite bit in Neopets so far has been the RPG you can play. It's you, playing your Neopet, playing an RPG.

Oh, Lish -- I made a haffer fury (named Tipa) on Nagafen last night. She's still on the island. I think I will betray my inkies, though, so I can make my spells and gear.

My daughter went out to neopets.com the other day . . . I'll have to track down what her name and race is now. I think it was some kind of penguin looking character.

@TIPA Send tell to Chapathy or Lish (my toons that I am on mostly). I'll friend you and send you a tell if i see you as well. Between me and the guildies, we should be able to craft just about anything. Time to start farming for Tipa.
