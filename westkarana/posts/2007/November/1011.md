> Countdown for blast-off. X Minus 5, 4, 3, 2, X Minus 1, Fire. From the far horizons of the unknown come transcribed tales of new dimensions in time and space. These are stories of the future. Adventures in which you will live in a million could-be years on a thousand maybe worlds. The National Broadcasting Corporation in cooperation with Galaxy Magazine presents . . . . X Minus One



What these "transcribed tales" are, are science fiction radio dramas, first broadcast throughout the fifties on NBC radio and listened to by millions of kids and adults in an era when TV was still pretty new-fangled.

126 episodes by the likes of Ray Bradbury, Robert Heinlein, Robert Sheckley and other luminaries of Science Fiction's Golden Age. Not just read -- no, fully acted out,

Load them into your iPod and travel through a million could-be years on a thousand maybe worlds.

If you ever watched and loved Twilight Zone or Outer Limits, you know what you're getting here, the same way now that everyone first got it, fifty five years ago.
