Melinda booted? I did *not* see that coming. Every poll I saw had Melinda well in front while Blake and Jordin were tied for second. So, Blake and Jordin move into the finals. I was looking forward to a Melinda/Blake bake-off. Who wins next week? I gotta go with Jordin. She is, after all, The Chosen One.
