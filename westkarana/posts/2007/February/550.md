*Posted by Tipa on 2007-02-26 10:26:25*

Day 1: Bloglines releases the [Bloglines Image Wall](http://www.bloglinesimagewall.com/), a dynamic collage of images taken from the blogs they index as they index them.

Day 2: Teachers, librarians and parents of young children [discover the content](http://www.bloglines.com/about/news) of a large portion of the images Bloglines finds on the blogs they index...

The collage that loaded included four clips of gay porn. The next screen redraw included naked waitresses and a guy humping a goat - pretend. I think. There was also an asian lady eating something........ possibly disturbing.

I let it run another minute or so after that and it was actually kind of interesting. If there was a way to exclude the million and one porn varieities it'd be cool. Problem is I doubt there's a way to do that.
