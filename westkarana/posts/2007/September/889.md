# OMG BACK!!!!!!

*kisses ground*

I actually was starting another blog in case this one didn't come back. I will probably still find another host....

I'm on Facebook now, courtesy of my sister. Look me up, add me to your friend's list. I'm also in the LinkedIn professional network so... if you need to know my real name, lemme know.

I like the vampire thing but it doesn't seem like anybody else plays but me. Also seems like something where the novelty is going to wear off soon. lol But this is far better then MySpace.
