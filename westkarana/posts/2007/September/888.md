History geeks tend to focus on a certain period (say, the Renaissance), or a particular person (perhaps, say, Charlemagne) and then know WAY too much about them. There were wargamers back at UNH which knew every detail about the War of the Roses you could find, probably because they were big Avalon Hill gamers. Which, let me tell you, was a particularly hardcore kind of gamer, back in the 70s.
