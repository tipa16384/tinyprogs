# Bioware Austin uses Perpetual's MMO Middleware

*Posted by Tipa on 2007-07-19 12:24:54*

Bioware, makers of Baldur's Gate (and Fallout, I think) currently working on an unannounced MMO (could it be a Fallout MMO?) [have licensed](http://www.developmag.com/news/28158/Another-tech-buy-for-BioWare) Perpetual's patcher/lobby/launcher etc code for use in their MMO.

Perpetual Entertainment are the developers of Gods and Heroes and the upcoming Star Trek Online.

SOE is publishing G&H, and has announced that title will be part of the Station Access, which means all the code they just licensed to Bioware, they won't themselves be using. At least, not for G&H.

Does this mean Bioware won't be coming to SOE to publish its MMO? There's been no news that they are even considering it, but I doubt it's anything anyone wants to do for themselves if they don't have to (MMO companies are likely very happy to leave the hosting/patching/CSR stuff to someone else). So who, then, will publish their MMO?

Not SOE, not NCSoft (who have a similar launcher)... could it be Turbine?
