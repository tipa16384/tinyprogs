# The Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale

*Posted by Tipa on 2007-12-27 13:17:14*

Dungeon Siege is my "oh my god, I have no internet connection" game on my laptop. When I saw what looked to be a cheesy generic fantasy flick trailer on the TV this weekend, I had no desire to go (Eragon cured me of that) (and yes, I've been told the book was way better). Then it ended with the title: "[In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460780/)".

Oh dear. A movie based on a game I actually played? I managed to resist Super Mario Bros, Double Dragon, Mortal Kombat, Doom, Silent Hill and dozens of others because I hadn't played the games.... but now I feel kinda obligated to go.

It's directed by famed schlockmeister [Uwe Boll](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uwe_boll). What could possibly go wrong?

Eragon, while very well written given the fact the kid was 16 when he finished it, is basically Star Wars in Pseudo Middle-earth. It's not bad... just hammy. There's little originality in any of the legions of text he puts into the thing, but then again who can fault him. The fantasy genre has been pillaged quite a bit over the years. 

I dunno... I would say it's good FOR TWEENS who want a less archaically written epic to introduce them to the world of Fantasy.

I thought to myself, "Hey, cool, a new fantasy movie," quickly followed by, "Wait-- is that Dungeon Siege? Oh god. Is that Uwe Boll? Oh god. That's going to be a train wreck and a half."

Wish they'd make a movie from Zelazny's "Amber" series. But on the other hand, maybe I don't.
