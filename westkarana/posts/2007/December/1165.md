# EQ2: The long march to level 80.

It took me half an hour to find the portal from Gorowyn to Kylong Plains. Those helpful geniuses at EQ2 Interface must have thought that big glowing purple portal was too obvious to mention, or I just haven't updated my maps recently...

Anyway, Rock Band interfered for awhile (drumming on Hard is HARD), but eventually I got down to business; Dera and Dina in the same zone. I wanted my son's character to come along, but then he got a CoA group. Decisions, decisions... well, obviously, CoA was going to be better for the short run with discovery and possibly useful loot, and he *did* ding from it and get some loot, but now he is behind on some Jarsath Wastes quests and it will be hard for him to catch up unless I go back and redo all the quests I've done. Then, though, he would always have to group with me for these quests so we wouldn't get out of sync, and that just won't happen.

Dina dinged level 79, and 126 AAs. Dera is 40% through 76. After I dinged, I was called to join the guild's Emerald Halls raid, so no more experience, just debt :P Ended 2% into 79 with 2.6% debt.

This weekend, TO DO in game: Get 80, and get moved in to Gorowyn. This is Christmas weekend, though, and I won't have all that much time for gaming, what with last minute shopping (I have it mostly done, but I still need some stocking stuffers), lots of Rock Band when my sister comes up, and Christmas itself in New Hampster.

Oh, what the heck. Here's a blurry Hartford, Connecticut, at night. Mmm snow. That tall building there is the tallest building in all of Connecticut. It's true! Wikipedia says so!

Are the houses there really that much better? I'm nearly to the point where I'm going to be looking to getting one of the larger dwellings and have been thinking maybe I should wait until I can check out Gorowyn before making any decisions.
