# No Country for Old Men

We went and saw this... disturbing movie today.

I'm not sure I would call it a movie. Maybe a war between the antagonist and the movie, as if the antagonist had decided that conventional ways of telling the story weren't going to end well for him, and so he fought back, changed things around.

This isn't really a movie at all, actually. There's something else happening up on the screen, and sometimes the movie characters seem to be on the verge of realizing, to their shock and dismay, that they are in a movie. At the end, Tommy Lee Jones' sheriff seems to have woken up from a dream -- and he does talk about dreams -- and not understand how he came to this point in the movie.

And then, it ends.

I don't know what was happening on the screen, but it was intensely interesting. Whatever it was.
