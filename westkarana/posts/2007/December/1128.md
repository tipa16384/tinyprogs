I just get a kick out of my comment spammers. I just loves them to death, always right there for me, telling me what a great writer I am, abstracting my posts and linking back to me... your kids might not like you, your spouse might not like you, your dog might not like you, but somewhere, there's a spammer who thinks you're great!

Just today, spammers named one post one of the greatest novels of the 20th century, and another, one of the top sensual movies of the age.

I've started adding these awards and honors into the posts so people know how special they are. Because, you know, how would they even know it was a movie? Even *I* didn't know that!
