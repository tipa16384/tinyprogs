I have backed a couple of games, like the Defense Grid kickstarter, because there were modest, attainable goals and there was a sincerity vibe. It felt like something was going to really come of it. And they have totally followed through post-funding. Good stuff.

But my standard response to most of these is to think, "Sounds great! Let me know when it is on Steam and has a few reviews and I will consider giving you my money then."

My thoughts echo Wilhelms, especially the final line.
