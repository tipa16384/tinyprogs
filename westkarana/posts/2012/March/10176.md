I had to wonder if there were any other puzzle pieces in any of my other character's homes. To my shock and welcome surprise, Marissa's wall contained a third mysterious puzzle piece.

It looks to be the right part of some sort of building or statue, which kinda implies it's on the right side of the puzzle, but not all the way to the edge. The yellow markings could mean Myth or maybe Balance. There's something poking up from the bottom which could be an axe or a hammer.

Which is it? I have no idea... and I can't wait to find out!
