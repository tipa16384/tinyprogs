After last week's mass dragon death in Gianthold Tor, we were back in the ~~Cornfields of Catastrophe~~ ~~Greenhouse of Gore~~ ~~Tidepools of Terror~~ Orchard of the Macabre. These civic leaders really need to work on coming up with better names for their neighborhoods or nobody's gonna want to move there.

The module failed to impress last time we went and this time was no different. We had our choice of beholders or vampires. Spode really wanted to get his vorpal freak on with vampires because, the problem with beholders is you can't really cut off their heads! But after dispatching some nameds in the Orchard, it was at Doomsphere's doors we found ourselves.

I think I remember the instance clearly. We go in, kill trash, fall through a floor, split the party to kill two guys at the same time, fall through a floor, find the boss, fall through a floor several times each time fighting a more difficult version of the boss and waves of trash.

The beholder, Doomsphere, eventually started walloping people with anti-magic rays. We wiped three times. Each wipe meant all but one of us had to release, heal, then fight back to the instance. The second time I didn't even get a chance to get rezzed before the party wiped again.

No loot to speak of, experience was crappy, no traps, monsters for the entire module are thick with incorporeal spooky types, only got three kills in the entire instance (really??? how is that possible?). I spent most of the night dead. I should have brought a book.

I'll be glad when we're done with this module. Ruins of Gianthold and Harbinger of Madness were way more fun.

I dinged a rank, I'm on the last rank before level 16. Ulan dinged sometime during the week, so I'm the last one... I should probably buy some hirelings and farm some xp this week.
