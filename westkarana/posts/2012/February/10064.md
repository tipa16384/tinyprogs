# Star Trek Online: The 2800 Return this weekend

*Posted by Tipa on 2012-02-06 22:08:56*



Who are "the 2800"? They are the 2,800 ships in the Dominion fleet that was swallowed up in the wormhole by the Prophets during a crucial point in the Dominion War. Their elimination gave starbase Deep Space 9 time to complete mining the mouth of the wormhole to the Gamma Quadrant, and was the turning point to a long, protracted war.

Now, they've apparently returned to continue the war.

This weekend, Saturday, February 12th, the Klingon Empire and the Federation will reluctantly join forces once again to battle the foe that nearly destroyed the Federation once before.

The Federation News Service will be there with a full report.

Since they added all of Star Treck (including that obscure cartoon from the 80s) to Netlfix, I have watched all of Voyager and gotten about 2/3 of the way through TNG. Was hoping to finish out TNG before DS9, but I've kind of bogged down in the former (about 5 seasons, and I feel like I've had enough of the characters).

The Dominion War is some of the best of DS9; but I think you only need to watch the last episode of season 5, "Call to Arms", to get the background for this feature episode.
