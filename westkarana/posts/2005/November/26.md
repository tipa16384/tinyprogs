Next big thing? I'm betting it's [electronic paper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_paper). The time to start thinking about how this can be used innovatively is now - and no better time, since [E Ink](http://www.eink.com/index.html) is offering a developer's kit fo $3000.

They give you all you need to integrate their display into your own device, or explore options with it.

How about combining it with a GPS device to make a portable map? Maybe it could also show some additional information about where you are. I dunno.

Trying to think of some non-obvious game ideas. If you could use a stylus with it, that would push the paper metaphor even more.

An interactive, graphical story, *a la* [The Diamond Age](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Age)?

Possibilities seem endless. But is one within my capabilities?
