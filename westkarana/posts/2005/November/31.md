# Wanted: Rich Troll

*Posted by Tipa on 2005-11-28 00:00:00*

My entry into the [RP Loot Brag Thread](http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?FN=wow-realm-kirintor&T=9072&P=1) of the essential roleplay gear we have.

I wear a [White Wedding Dress](http://www.thottbot.com/?i=5658) when I go husband shopping. Like dat guy who walk through da daylit street holding a lantern an' searchin' for an honest man, I go troo da streets of Orgrimmar wit a boquet of flowers lookin' for a rich troll.

I see a troll, he look like he dress well, eat well, I ask him, "Hey! You rich?" An' if he say "ya mon", den I whack him on da head and get married to him before he wake up hopefully. I be a priestess so I can do dis ting pretty quick.

I remember my ma tellin' me about da first time she an' pa meet. It was love at first sight. I always remember what pa ask ma first time he see her. He say, "Where am I?"

He would say dat again an' again until he finally escape when I was about two. I hunt him down someday. Ma know where he be hiding, but it no hurry, cuz she got his money already.

Ma pretty big deal shamaness, she give me a potion she brew up so hopefully when I find "Mistah Right", he not have dose thoughts of escapin' and pressin' criminal charges an' whatnot. He be havin' no thoughts at all.
