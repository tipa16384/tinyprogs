# Slashdot

In the beginning, there was [Slashdot](http://www.slashdot.org), "News for Nerds". I posted replies now and again, and eventually, they started giving me moderator points - the ability to push posts up and down in the ranking. And then they started letting me META-moderate posts - grading the moderators.

Can I use this on my resume?

Who moderates the meta-moderators? [Who watches the Watchmen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen)?
