Although they aren't the best-looking of the alliance races, dwarves are the most hardy and stout. A reliable dwarf is a good friend to have.

As a paladin, you like to see that everyone is safe - including yourself. Still an important part of any group, if you get overshadowed, you can always refuse to give them your blessing.

Funny, a dwarf paladin is just what I started on the Aussie server. But honestly, after so many years playing pencil-and-paper RPGs as well as single player and MMO RPGs, I know what I like to play. Clerics and rogues.

Of course, this test was for your REAL LIFE class... and I have to admit, it's not what I would have picked for my real life WoW class. Human Priestess with Gnomish Engineering and Alchemy for professions would probably be closest to me real life.
