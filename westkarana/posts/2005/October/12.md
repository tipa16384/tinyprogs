# What happened in CE?

Well, fact is, sometimes I get really depressed. I can't do a thing about it. I start hitting my head with stuff, jabbing screwdrivers into my legs and so on. It's a huge pressure to keep it to myself at work, and when I get home, it explodes.

End result is, I am complaining all the time in game, and making other people angry with me and I am getting angrier with myself all at the same time. So last night after we wiped in Council of Nine, I just refused the rez, logged off, and played WoW until bedtime.

Soloing is relaxing. And what's more, playing with people who don't know me is a break. I don't know why I feel it is okay to abuse my friends online, when among strangers, I am much better.

Maybe with this blog, I can chart moments of depression, and see if they have any sort of pattern.

I don't want to turn this into a pity-me whinefest, though. Everything I write seems to end that way, and I can't bear to look at it ever again. I guess it's cathartic, being bitchy, but I don't want to see myself in that way.

Nicolas Cage finds catharsis in archery in [The Weather Man](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/weather_man/). Sounds like a good movie.

A movie I'm undecided about is [Jarhead](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jarhead/). With a daughter and a son-in-law in the Marines, this movie hits close to home.

My daughter says she may have to go to war late next year. [2000 Americans](http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/10/25/iraq.main/index.html) have died there so far, and they estimate, 30,000 civilians. I don't know how we can win this war. If we were invaded, wouldn't we fight, and keep fighting?
