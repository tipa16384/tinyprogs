# Sulu is gay?

[George Takei says, "I'm gay"](http://www.cnn.com/2005/SHOWBIZ/TV/10/28/people.georgetakei.ap/index.html?section=cnn_topstories)

People popping out all over! It's odd and amazing how you can look at a person one day, and at the same person another day, and they become totally different. But hey, if someone had said, which Star Trek cast member is gay, I'd have picked him.

I logged on to EQ, gathered my corpse and attended the Halloween raid (though the event ended prematurely for some reason). I stayed out of channels aside from cleric channel, which I kinda have to be in to do my job. Afterward, we did Jurek and one of Bininon's 1.5 fights after (the same one I did with Felwyn on Stromm) in an RCoD instance.

And then, on to WoW.

I'm really having trouble with the RP for Troll races. There just doesn't seem to be much to do there. Maybe it's just me - heck, I know it is. So I started a gnome rogue (Tipa, natch), and slipped into character incredibly easily.

Horde, I tried. I'll still play Kanda (there being no pressure to play or level her, so I will continue), but now my soul is in Tipa 2.0. Well, I have a Tipa in EQ2 (halfling monk, Lavastorm), so I guess... this would be Tipa 3.0.

Made level 10 this morning while gathering parts to finish a machine to turn leper gnomes back into non-leper gnomes.

It's Friday!
