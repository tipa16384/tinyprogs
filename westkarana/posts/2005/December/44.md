# Spaceport in New Mexico

*Posted by Tipa on 2005-12-09 00:00:00*

Just reading this story about Virgin Galactic builing a [spaceport in New Mexico](http://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/space/12/08/virgin.space.reut/index.html) brings me back to my childhood, reading those Heinlein stories and dreaming about the future.

I am glad to be alive when the 'future' is happening.

On the same page as that story, were stories about the accelerating erosion of one of the largest glaciers in the world due to climate change, the Great Lakes in danger, and the United States refusing to join the world in reducing global-warming gas emission.

Do we deserve the future?
