# The Little Mermaid

*Posted by Tipa on 2006-04-28 00:00:00*

I never played Kingdom Hearts, where famous Final Fantasy characters meet up with famous Disney characters and go on an adventure. I used to be a big Disney fan when I was a kid... watched Wonderful World of Disney *every* Sunday, with popcorn of course, saw every Disney movie (mostly live action when I was growing up; they weren't really doing animation then).

I'm not sure why I stopped being a Disney fan. Maybe it was just the pervasive unreality - I was *angered* about Gladstone Gander's magical power of luck. He could do ANYTHING - because he was so lucky. If he was stranded on a deserted tropical isle - with Donald and Daisy, of course - his luck would provide him a rowboat stocked with delicious fruit.

I guess I should also be angry with Larry Niven for ripping off the idea for a character in "Ringworld".

So, having not played the first, I doubt I'll end up playing the sequel. But I see it has Neptune's undersea kingdom in it, along with his daughter, Ariel.

I guess things didn't work out with the prince, then? I'm not surprised. She and he came from two different worlds... there's things you learn on land that you would never, ever learn underwater. Important things, like bladder control.

I bet they didn't sleep together too many nights before *that* became a problem.
