# R.I.P. Rio Karma

*Posted by Tipa on 2006-09-14 00:13:43*

I promise, I'll get back to fun EQ2 (and EQ1!) stuff soon. Just... well, I usually prepare and write the blog entries on Baphomet, whom you may remember as my Linux computer. Ever since I accidentally updated a file I didn't mean to update, Baph has been getting sicker and sicker.

First Amarok wouldn't play my music anymore. Then the sound engine gave up the ghost entirely. The fonts got all screwy after a ill-considered move to modular X (the graphics subsystem). Lately, KDE (the window manager) has been freezing. In a Linux system, that doesn't mean the computer stops working -- I could still get into it through the internet or my LAN and do things -- but it made it a lot less useful for the purposes I built it.

So, faced with reinstalling Gentoo (estimated time: a week of long nights), or doing a one-button Kubuntu install... I went with Kubuntu. I stopped using it a long time ago because *it slowly stopped working*. Yeah. Just like Gentoo did, though it did run smoothly for quite a long time. I'm running the cool [Automatix](http://www.getautomatix.com/ "Automatix") script that gets all the stuff you want but Kubuntu forgot to give you right now. Mostly media players and stuff.

I am giving up some stuff, not using Gentoo. I'd tuned MPlayer so that it was a *monster*.

Hmm... just finished... rebooting... well, it seems okay. Configured itself for my widescreen monitor without trouble. Fiddling with /etc/fstab so it can see my mondo 250Gb storage drive and my Windows drive... Now to get Inkscape, Image Magick, and... crap. I forgot to copy over all my batch image processing scripts. Oh yeah, need to resurrect my SSH server so I can connect from work, too.

Anyway, I have full faith it will work fine. I've recently installed it on my laptop and made a mail server based upon it at work.

Much later: Works fine. I have to do the new Crimson Eternity news tonight, and I have to have a good sit and think for a couple of hours to get my thoughts and ideas together before I start.

My Rio Karma, my ugly little MP3 player, died. It had been sick before; its hard drive didn't work for awhile. A couple of sharp shocks brought it back to life (yes, this was what the engineers who designed it recommended). It limped on with some errors for a few months more, but today it would not revived.

What's worse, it had my *entire CD collection* on it - nearly 3500 separate songs. They're all backed up on my Linux box, luckily - stored in an obscure format called Ogg Vorbis. It was going to be tough to find an MP3 player that could hold my entire collection, support Ogg, and be affordable.

![iRiver Clix](http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:3c9wDSszWhDf4M:http://gadgets.macworld.com/images/2006/05/iriver-clix.jpg "iRiver Clix")I wasn't searching long before I came across the iRiver Clix. This is simply the cutest MP3 player I've ever seen. Unfortunately, it didn't really meet my criteria - at 2 Gigs, it couldn't even come close to holding my collection, which means I could only have a portion of my library on it at any one time. And after all my Blue Oyster Cult, my Cambridge Singers, my Mike Oldfield, and all my other important vital albums... I'd be out of space. As cute as the Clix is, I can't use it.

An iPod was out of the question. It doesn't support Ogg and I am NOT going to spend another few weekends re-ripping all my CDs. Plus, iTunes doesn't work under Linux. They're a little pricey. I decided to look at some of the "iPod Killers".

![iAudio](http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:flSiT4xGtwrkVM:http://www.uhu.ch/images/iaudio_x5.gif "iAudio")I eventually decided upon the Cowon iAudio, a 30 gig MP3 player that also played low-bitrate MP4 encoded videos, had a drag-and-drop interface which worked seamlessly with Linux, and could play songs downloaded from Windows Media Player "Plays For Sure" stores if I really wanted to catch up on my Coldplay and Britney Spears.

I can't wait for it to arrive. Sometimes I need to concentrate at work. I need music to shut out the distractions. My little Rio did that job for months and months; I hope this iAudio works as well. Or better.

Looks just like the picture of it above, without the snarling brunette. It charged up very quickly. Since my home network happily, and secretly, assigned itself a new IP address last night, I couldn't drag any of my collection down. I really need to write a script that lets me know whenever it changes, and mails me the new one.

I'm teaching myself Python right now -- that would be a good first project.

Anyway. I found a site that had some Creative Commons-licensed classical music, so I downloaded, plugged the iAudio into my Windows computer and... well, it needed some drivers or something. It came with a driver disk, but I really don't want to be installing personal software on my work computers.

I turned to my Linux computer, plugged it in, and it immediately recognized it and put an icon for it on the desktop. Dragged the music folder into it, unplugged it and there it was, and am listening to it now.

I haven't read the manual, so maybe I will suddenly gaze upon it and become enlightened, but the Rio Karma UI was so incredibly easy that it spoiled me with its automatically generated playlists and rock-solid obvious UI.

When I get home I'll load all my music, a few episodes of Battlestar Galactica and Lost on it, and some pictures, and give it a real workout.

FM radio works well, except reception is crappy and I only get one radio station clearly. I had to turn it off after about ten minutes of solid commercials. I can't listen to that, that long. I was hoping to get NPR.
