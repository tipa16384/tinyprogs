# Superachievers and Underachievers

This picture is from a [Newsweek article](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14638573/site/newsweek/page/3/ "For Today's School Kids, Pressure Starts Early") about kids who are being driven to achieve too much, too soon. My sister was kind of blase about sending this link out. But hey, kid's in a national magazine...

Out of the four of us, my three sisters and I, I'm the only one that plays MMOs. My sister Hillary chides me that I won't do anything unless it involves killing monsters or something. I laugh, but it hurts. Has it always been that way?

I often tell people I'm glad EverQuest only came around after my kids were raised so I never had to make that awful choice about priorities. My kids were always priority #1.

Of course, now I can (and do) devote most of my free time to MMOs. So let's look at my fortunes compared to those of my sisters...

Vallerie - rich, living a wonderful life devoting her time to her daughters.

Hillary - well off. Supergenius mathematics and algorithm designer for a Boston defense contractor. Beautiful apartment outside Boston with a wonderful boyfriend. Able to give my daughter things for her baby that I can't.

Jennifer - doing okay. Beautiful daughter that she dotes on, working in one of the top accounting firms in the world in NYC.

Me - scraping by. Losing money each month I work at a low end IT/everything else job, putting my son through college as we make do as two adults in a one bedroom apartment I can't afford. Before MMOs (and admittedly, before the dot-com bust that put me and thousands of other programmers out of work), I was making $80k/year. I made $50/hour contracting at Apple back in the early 90s! Now I make far, far less.

My family says: Get a better job. Hillary says, move to Boston and get an entry level programming job where she works and get back into the swing of things. Everyone says, if you aren't getting paid enough, leave!

But the thing is, this is an hourly job, and when I finish work, I can go home and do whatever I like. I don't have the crushing schedules I had when I was programming. Worst thing I have to do is, like this morning, bug Covad about why our SDSL was down, print some mailing labels, set up a new user on our servers and fix a database updating problem in the warehouse (note to my boss: it's not DO...WHILE NOT EOF. It's WHILE NOT EOF DO... that backwards test caused a nasty crash when a search returned no records...)

Anyway. It's sour grapes, I know. So ignore this rant :) I was going to do a nice new EQ2 post, but I had to reset my DSL modem this weekend and my home computers have a new Dynamic IP address, so I can't connect to them from work.

I don't need the wealth in order to be that way. Could I achieve more? Well, it depends on what people want to term the word 'more' as. For now, I'm content doing what I'm doing, despite the 'scraping by' my folks or other relatives may term it as.
