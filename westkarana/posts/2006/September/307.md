Do my shoulders look fat in this armor?

No, really. Be honest. Be *cruel*.

I can slice you. I can turn to the left -- *sssssssstt* -- and the right -- *ppphhhhwwwwitt* -- and my shoulders will take you out.

And if you come after me, my shoulders will fly me away from you.

I have a *ferret* living in my shoulder-wings. His name is *Nibbler*. He is taking all your money while you *stare at my shoulders*.

Now if you'll pardon me, I have to go stand in front of the auction house in Ironforge and show off my shoulders because *the bigger the shoulders, the wtfpwnzer teh n00bz*.
