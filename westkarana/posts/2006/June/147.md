# City of Heroes

Paragon City needs me back! City of Heroes is letting all the retired superheroes out of the superhero stasis chambers from now until the end of the week. I got a little excited when I read the email. There were some good memories in there...

I found City of Heroes repetitive after awhile. But flying was a lot of fun... I'm going to do it. I'm going to check in on my supergals once more. If I can find my CoH disks.

Flying really was a lot of fun.
