An MMO I'm not going to play... but it's hilarious... a released MMO with such HORRID misspellings and syntax all through it... I felt a little epileptic just reading the combat log... and the Auny'Ainah of Life? That's a low level *pig*, the kind you find all over the Dwarf/Gnome newbie grounds in World of Warcraft. I can only imagine what the higher level critters are called.

Dark & Light: Horrid Manifestation of Fulgent Evil from the Nether Realms

All other games: Lion

Dark & Light: Hooonyhah Avatar of the Fifth Chakra

All other games: Horse

Always the chance they released this game as a parody of MMOs!

P.S. - the guy who posted [these screenshots](http://www.darkandlight.net/forums/showthread.php?t=60592) really liked the game.
