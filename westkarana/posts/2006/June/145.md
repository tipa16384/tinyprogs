# Rakuraku Dinokun!

*Posted by Tipa on 2006-06-06 00:00:00*

A long long LONG time ago... like half the rest of the world, I was crazy about virtual pets. My favorite? Rakuraku Dinokun (or Friendly Little Dino). My old blog from around 1996-2000, Penultimatum, was disappeared (and the domain name stolen, STOLEN, by someone else!), but the Internet Archive had bits and pieces... including some of my painstakingly hand-drawn and animated scenes from a Dinokun's life. Some of these live on in other people's pages... I made these on a Macintosh. I hadn't yet used a PC...

**aya** writes: yeah, i want my old one back. it was like aqua i think. i bought one off ebay, but it's all cheap and crappy and it turned out to be a dog, not the dinosaur. $$$7.00 down the drain. i still want a real one, real bad. can you email me too please if you know where to get one?

**susan** writes: i just found one! I GOT AN ORIGINAL.

hard, but yaa, i got the white one for $12 off of ebay. you have to make sure you get the EXACT one though. here's a pic on the original (don't buy anything else that looks KINDA' like it, make sure it's EXACT; this goes for packaging as well): http://www.bookmice.net/fleur/rakuraku/raku-5.jpg

sadly the seller only had one (he found it in his basement when he was cleaning it or something), so good luck finding one.

I need to dig out my two someday...

**Alberto** writes: I found some authentic dinkie dinos for few bucks. The seller is a very good ebayer! Hope this helps out, cheers.
