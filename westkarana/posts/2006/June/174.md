There's [this web page](http://www.eqsig.com/) that generates EQ2 signatures... wonder what it looks like! They don't give a preview, so adding it here.

Wow, that's spartan. I'd add a picture of Dina on there, but for some reason I can't contact my home computers from work. Probably the router reset and changed the dynamic IP address... I'd get a static IP if I could afford it. The phone company would consider me a BUSINESS if I asked, though, and vroooOOOOOMMMM up go the monthly rates.

Here's Brita's, from EQ1... probably look just as crappy...
