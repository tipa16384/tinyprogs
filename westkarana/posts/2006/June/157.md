# Widescreen Gaming

So what does having a 1650 x 1050 monitor get you these days? It's a Viewsonic 2025wm, and I've been droooling over it for awhile. I didn't buy it for gaming, really - I bought it for doing everything that isn't gaming. And it is very very nice for that.

But for gaming... well, in EQ2, I can see my whole inn room, pretty much...

Or in EQ1, see an entire cleric-unfriendly vista at once... but I'm not bitter. I love Depths of Darkhollow. No, really.

Or in WoW, see how few polys they use for the characters :P though that's hard to see in this thumbnail...
