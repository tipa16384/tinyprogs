# Photoshop on Linux

Why use [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/), when you can use Photoshop?

I love my little Linux box.

I needed to do a bunch of image manipulation fast, and while GIMP may be this incredible program, it isn't one I have spent the last ten years learning. I downloaded [WINE](http://www.winehq.com/) (WINE Is Not an Emulator), installed and ran Photoshop using that, and... just worked perfectly.
