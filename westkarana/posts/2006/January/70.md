# Hero&#039;s Journey

*Posted by Tipa on 2006-01-20 00:00:00*

Well, if Sigil doesn't hire me (/target tipa; /powerword: hireme-aura), I can do the same thing for free for [Hero's Journey](http://www.play.net/hj/). That's that MMO with huge customization - look the way you want, what your clothes look like doesn't affect your abilities - like City of Heroes. It looks really slick.

Vanguard is still my first choice for a "third generation" game, but... if I could get game design experience (working for free), it would be a powerful step forward in joining game design for pay.

It would still involve giving up all other MMOs for the nonce. I know me well enough to know that being an active player in an MMO crowds out all other leisure time activities.

They want people to do level design and art as well. I wonder how much of the game is currently done...
