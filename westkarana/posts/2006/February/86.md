# Splitpaw

*Posted by Tipa on 2006-02-11 00:00:00*

Tonight I finallty got a chance to explore Splitpaw in EQ2. The entire thing scales to your party level, but with Dera mentoring Nashuya, that was no problem. We came, we saw gnolls, we killed gnolls...

Dera probably wished she had chosen a different title right about then... Actually, that's Nashuya with a gnoll illusion on. One mission sends you in disguise... but they're not fooled, they know who you are. Other missions include a solo arena showdown (Nashuya won it easily; Dera had to quit after round seven) and other stuff that really wanted a full group.

One of the most elaborate solo missions in Splitpaw is one where you relive the glory days of one of Splitpaw's heroes, Harclave. To get the quest, you have to listen as this gnoll goes on... and on.... and on..........
