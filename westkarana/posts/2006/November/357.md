Just finished a new Haven Girl brochure and put it on the web via Picasa 2. People inside the company are even asking for me to put things up here; it has truly become a useful way of getting high resolution pictures of our lines to people for use in advertising.

The JPEGs Photoshop CS2 made look a lot darker than the original TIFs. I wonder if this is due to the TIFs being in CYMK and the JPEGS in RGB.

Meh. Waddya want for free.

I need to put these up on the website. I just started looking at the Django web app API for Python, so it could be pretty soon when we can host our web pages internally.

Picasa 2 also generates HTML code for embedding a link to the album in a blog, so trying that out as well.
