# EQ2: Scatter's Long Jump

*Posted by Tipa on 2006-12-20 08:40:39*

I used to make a lot of comics for EQ1 but haven't done the same yet with EQ2. Here's a little comic about my level 13 Fae berzerker traveling to the Bonemire to make the longest flight ever - from the Catotoxic Stain to the Halls of Fate.

In my next comic, I won't use any in-game text balloons. They tend to be in bad places and don't take well to zooming and cropping and don't give me the freedom to change what PCs and NPCs are saying. Also, instead of using Photoshop for the whole thing, I used "The GIMP" to prepare the panels and Inkscape for the one text balloon I added, compositing and export of the final product.
