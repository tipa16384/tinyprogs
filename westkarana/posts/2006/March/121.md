# The ABCs of EMail

*Posted by Tipa on 2006-03-30 00:00:00*

[Abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijk.com](http://abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijk.com) wants to give you the longest email address in the world! Among the many advantages of having the address -

1. Some webforms are unable to read your email address

2. Some email software cannot be configured

3. People have a hard time typing in your email address

4. Companies think your email address is fake

An idea for our busy, modern, spam-infested lives.
