The Prophetic Fate Pokemon League followed rumors of a legendary fire Pokemon to a deep, lava-lit cavern. It took us three hours just to roll the giant-sized Pokeball down through Molten Core to capture him.

Each member of Team Fate readied their favorite Pokemon; I took Nohielfoyu's pokeball from my belt; got ready to throw it in. The beast roared; forty pokeballs rained down on him; and in the end, the giant pokeball rocked back and forth as the monster captured within struggled to get free.

We're going to let him out in Goldshire.
