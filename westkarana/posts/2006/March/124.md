# Quest Armor For The W1n

*Posted by Tipa on 2006-03-04 00:00:00*

![](../../../images/nashquestarmor.jpg) Nashuya is level 32, nearly 33... this is level 20-ish quest armor... she has upgraded most of the pieces already, usually even before she got the corresponding quest item but that doesn't matter! She looks GREAT in it! The help available for this quest tapered off more and more as I fell behind the guild leveling curve... in the end I finished it myself, just Nashuya and Dera fighting creatures for the trinkets the smith in East Freeport demanded.

She wields the Shiny Brass Halberd, condemned as a junk weapon by the long-bearded sages of the 20-29 chat channel. Ah, well. Thems the breaks when you level largely two-boxing in outdoor zones; you don't get the good loot. I'd get better if I just played Dera, or if groups would not expect me to TANK. I'm a DPS Shadow Knight!

Sigh...

Now, I suppose I can begin leveling once more :)
