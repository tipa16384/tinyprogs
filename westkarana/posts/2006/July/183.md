# New WoW Server

I said I wouldn't play World of Warcraft again until they made a new Pacific Time Roleplay server... and a friend wrote me to tell me that they have done just that. Sentinels. Before work this morning I logged in, made a troll shaman named Yenna, ran around a little and ... it's just like when Kirin Tor was new. And so six months from now, it will become the non-RP, trashtalking mess that KT became.

The friend who wrote me mentioned this morning that he's playing on Alliance side with his wife. I like Alliance characters, I do - Tipa of the Snacks of the Horde is one of my favorite RP characters. Yet it's Alliance that roleplays the least, that tries its best to destroy the character of every roleplay server.

On the other hand, I just did the whole Horde thing. I don't know how it will all work out, if I'll even play WoW seriously again -- having so much fun in EQ2 at the moment.

Whichever way it goes, you'll read about it here.
