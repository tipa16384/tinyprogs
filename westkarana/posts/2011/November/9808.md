# TV Watch: Being Human (UK)

*Posted by Tipa on 2011-11-07 11:42:06*

I didn't expect that a series about a ghost, a vampire and a werewolf living together in a Bristol flat would actually be a really compelling drama. I just had this idea it could only be a comedy. "Being Human" is a really great show.  
  
Aaaaaand the home page contains a spoiler. Which I didn't know until I linked it.

I mean come on .. and syfy markets as a original series..   
  
I need to get the BBC version .. I think I'd like it more.. I've always liked the British versions better.. Steptoe and Son, Torchwood.. you know the good ones ;)

Hadn't heard of Bedlam; thanks for the tip!
