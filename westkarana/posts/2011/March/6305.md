# Wizard101: It's MOUNT WEEK!

*Posted by Tipa on 2011-03-30 00:28:56*

[![](../../../uploads/2011/03/mantaray.gif "It's Manta Ray week!")](../../../uploads/2011/03/mantaray.gif)Discovery Channel may have their Shark Week, but that's kinda lame, if you ask me. They'd be better off having a Manta Ray week.

The first place they'd have to come to find the Very Best Manta Rays would be very deep in the Spiral, in a watery realm called Celestia. Maybe Selena Gomez could mention it to them because, heck, she's been there already. She's scoped out the fine mantas of Calypso's realm for sure. Camera crews might be on their way -- in fact one camera crew surprised me in my home while I was training a new crop of rays.

Fact is, we're overstocked with manta rays. I can't afford to keep them all, and besides, who can ride more than one? KingsIsle has graciously offered me codes for fifteen of the startled looking ocean gliders, so here's what we're going to do. I'm going to tell you a few facts about manta rays, and at the end I'm going to ask you a question about manta rays. Leave a comment with your answer, and I will randomly choose fifteen of the correct answers and send you a code for a Permanent Manta Ray mount!

A couple of rules before we get started: Make sure you leave an e-mail address where you can be reached with the comment -- there's a field for it. Don't put your e-mail address in the body of the comment, spammers will find it there.

Second, the contest will run from Wednesday, March 30 to Thursday, April 7th.

Third, I do not work for KingsIsle; I have no affiliation with them aside from being a big fan of Wizard101. I can't get more codes; when these are gone, they're gone.

SO ANYWAY! Here's some facts about MANTA RAYS.

 2. Manta rays love paintings by **A ARTY MAN**.

 4. Serve sweet potatoes to a manta ray and you'll hear **A YAM RANT**.

 6. if a manta ray goes to a zoo, they will stop and stare **AT ANY RAM**.

 8. Last time a manta ray went to a concert, it **RAN AT MYA**.

 10. And in spring, manta rays like to swim in **A MAY TARN**.




Now the question for YOU is...

**What is a manta ray's favorite insect?**

Leave a comment and let me know below!

Mary, a ant.

**jacob besser** writes: It took me a while to get this and I got really caught up in the question. I ended up looking at all the things a Manta Ray eats and the type of food a domesticated Manta Ray would eat. Then i noticed all the hints above the question and couldn't help but slap myself in the face. Switch some letters around in the name manta ray and you get army ant, wow I feel really dumb. When I was little I would always go to the aquarium across from my house, they had a petting zoo section in one of the wings. Manta rays were always my favorite. =)

And their answer to if they’ve eaten a rodent would be MANY A RAT
And don’t get a manta ray anger or it MAY A RANT
But most important is if you ask a manta ray why it likes its favorite wizard spell, it will tell it is because RA MAY TAN the enemy
Also i did not copy and paste from that essem girl it took me five hours to figure it out and when i came online and saw these post i was real mad that she post the comment before me
Psp I love manta Rays

**Kate** writes: Well, the riddle leads to A ARMY ANT. But that seems too easy. Soooo... at the Henry Doorly Zoo, in Omaha, NE, the person working in the aquarium told me that the rays there are very big fans of krill, but that they have definite personalities-- she had one who only liked them on one side of the tank, and would patiently wait until the feeders refilled the preferred feeding station.

However, the thing that got me most about them is how enormous they can become! I don't live near an ocean, and to hear that manta rays can become almost 30 feet across is just amazing.

~They let small fish clean them 
~Only 4 aquariums in the world have manta rays, because they are so big

**Terrill Schmidt** writes: A ARMY ANT 
using the letters of MANTA RAY.

While the top dark surface of the Manta Ray is leathery, the underside is soft almost Jello like. 

On Grand Cayman Island, the main bay is filled with rays (Sting Ray Bay). The rays have been gathering here for many years looking for easy food. 50 years ago when fishing was the primary industry in Grand Cayman, the fishermen would fillet and cut the fish they caught in the middle of the bay, typically in the evenings or night. The bay is very large and shallow. This is good for 2 reasons: the shallow water keeps there boats from moving alot. The large bay was far enough from shore were there were no mosquitoes. The fishermen would dump the remains overboard. This attracted many blood thirsty sea creatures. But since the water was only 2-3 feet deep, the manta & sting rays were one of the few animals that could swim there to eat. They have been hanging out there for over 50 years now. Now it is because of tourists handing out food.

**FireSparkGirl** writes: Hello :)

I think the answer is "Army Ant". I can tell this is the answer because in every little sentence the same letters where posted in black bold letters. And if you notice, in all of the answers, theres 8 letters. It does take a while, but all you have to do is think and look carefully because sometimes there might be a little trick. Nice word scramble by the way.

With lots of love and generosity,
