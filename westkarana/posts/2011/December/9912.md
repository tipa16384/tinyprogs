Star Trek Online is giving away light sabers! Well, light lipra and light bak'leths. You don't even have to sell your soul to the Jedi Council or the Sith Lords. Just talk to a Ferengi in Q's Winter Wonderland. Unlike other melee weapons, though, these have an energy edge and don't ignore shields (despite what the description reads). That's one of the huge advantage of melee weapons in Star Trek Online; they go right through the shields and do damage to the now-unprotected flesh. Or flesh-like substance.

I didn't see anyone wielding any of these in last night's run of the Infected ground mission. I'd done this a long, long time ago and didn't expect any problems. But, this mission has been changed a little bit. Now the Borg adapt to your weapons, so you have to keep changing your weapons out or use a frequency remodulator.

They can also assimilate members of the party. I was assimilated. My character sprouted Borg headgear and was entirely out of my control for about a minute. Then someone shot me or I just shook it off; there's a device that can cure this, too, if you use it fast enough. I was totally unprepared.

We made it fine to the Borg queen room, but the party leader disconnected. I assumed everyone else knew what to do, but it turns out I was the only one who did. By the time I realized I needed to explain the final encounter to everyone, too many had left.

I play a medic. I am trying to keep people alive. So that was a waste of time.

I repeated Borg Special Task Force space missions on my Klingon commander until I got the complete Borg ship set. I'm now doing the same for my Federation commander with HER ship. I do love that Nebula. It took me a few minutes to get back into the swing of things with the Nebula, but I found it has far more survivability than my Klingon's Kar'Fi carrier. Though the Nebula's DPS isn't that great, its huge variety of buffs and debuffs combine to bring it out on top.

When the STFs first came out, this level of gear was all you could get. Now the Omega Force -- a joint command formed of both Klingon Empire and Federation elite forces -- offers several tiers of advanced gear. It's the standard MMO end-game faction and token grind, re-labeled.

It's an uneasy fit. In Star Trek, either you're the captain of a starship, OR you're the leader of an away team, OR you're a member of a party doing a specific job. It's hard to think of any high level admiral in the real navy training hard to be able to wear better gear. If the admiral wanted it, he or she would just requisition it.

Though Star Trek Online does call these requisitions, they require rare Borg salvages or Encrypted Data Chips to be turned in for requisitions, and these are gotten only through STFs.

Why can't I just tell my crew to do the STFs and give me their stuff?

Anyway.

Aside from the daily STO cow clicking, I think I need to spend some time in some other MMO for a little while. Maybe Guild Wars.
