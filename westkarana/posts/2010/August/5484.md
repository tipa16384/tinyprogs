Tremendously, actively fun Japanese import "Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale" has finally gained a publisher! Stardock will publish Recettear through its Impulse digital distribution network. Ten thousand people downloaded the demo after the gaming media gave it rave reviews ([including me](../../../index.php/2010/07/22/recettear-an-item-shops-tale/)), which got translators Carpe Fulgur enough pull to get a major distributor interested.

Good job, guys -- I absolutely cannot wait to play the full game!

Founder Andrew Dice [broke the news](http://www.carpefulgur.com/forum/index.php?topic=83.msg949#msg949) on the Recettear forums today:


> Carpe Fulgur and Recettear have received a lot of great press. We've now got a legion of fans who are pretty much howling for the release of the full game. We even have cosplayers, which is a little bit staggering.

And yet, it's been something of a struggle to get distributors to take us seriously. An indie game from Japan, localized by a pack of nobodies? Are they for real? Why would we want to carry their game that nobody would want to buy?

Well. Ten thousand demo downloads in under a month don't lie. Quality, we hope, doesn't lie. And now one distributor has said: "Yes, they're for real. And we'll help them."

After a month of hand-wringing, we are pleased to announce that Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale will be sold on Stardock's Impulse platform. Stardock has been a supporter of independent software development for over a decade and we're thrilled to be going up on Impulse.

Recettear will be available for purchase on Impulse for the price of 20 USD in North America, 15 Euros in the European Union and 13 GBP in Great Britain, and is tentatively scheduled for release on September 10th, 2010. This date may change slightly depending on certain factors involved with the QA process for both Carpe Fulgur and Impulse, but that is the current target date.

We couldn't have gotten this far without the support of our fans. You guys allow us to seize the lightning, and now it has been seized. We may announce more distributors in the future, but either way, Recettear is coming!

The service is aptly named in my case, as I frequently see a game that "looks cool" and buy it. Then while it downloads I get distracted and forget about it. Which reminds me, I really need to update my Elemental beta . . .
