# Wizard101: 10,000,000 Players, +1

*Posted by Tipa on 2010-06-25 19:00:34*

Wizard101 recently announced their ten millionth player, a not-inconsiderable achievement for a non-free to play game. Even given second or third accounts, millions of people have spent some bit of their lives enjoying the mystic worlds of the Spiral. Tara Windwalker wrote me today to share the sad but somehow joyful story of Emma Elizabeth Bradford, one of those ten million.

Yesterday, I was doing a search of online posts featuring current news about Wizard101 and found an obituary for Emma Elizabeth Bradford, a 7 year old girl, who was a Wizard101 fan. Emma's obituary is one of the most beautiful that I have ever read. I don't know if I ever saw or met Emma in the Wizard101 game but we probably share(d) the joy that Wizard101 adds to our lives through its humor and wonderful graphics. 

You will find the obituary and a link to the Guest Book [here](http://www.rapidcityjournal.com/news/article_0717af26-7f51-11df-9c8c-001cc4c03286.html). From reading Emma's obituary, it seems that she lived a life filled with wonder, joy, and laughter ... which is very similar to my first time playing Wizard101 ... there was magic in those moments. Emma seems to have lived her whole life that way.

This probably isn't the first time a game has been mentioned in an obituary but it strikes me that there is a wonderful story behind Emma's obvious love of Wizard101. The more that I think of it, the more of a story unfolds ... not just about Emma, who seems to have been lovely but the story of how gaming is enmeshed in our lives now (a 7 year old girl). I did notify Professor Greyrose on Facebook. I wanted to tell Todd Coleman but he doesn't want gamers to post on his "civilian" facebook site anymore.
 
I made this graphic thinking of her.

R.I.P Emma, R.I.P. 

May the Sun shine above
"
Sweet dreams till sun beams find you
Sweet dreams seem to whisper I love you
But, in your dreams wherever you be,
Dream a Little of Dream of Me,"
