All the thrill of the adventuring life RIGHT IN YOUR BROWSER! Play for a minute, play for an hour, play for a LIFETIME! Fight fantastic creatures from your imagination and beyond! Go on hair raising missions that will shape the future of the UNIVERSE!

(Caution: some advanced adventures may require multiple presses of the button to complete).

By way of [Scott Jennings](http://www.mmorpg.com/showFeature.cfm/feature/4097/page/2), [Progress Wars](http://progresswars.com/) is a parody by [Jakob Skjerning](http://mentalized.net "Expert web developer specialized in Ruby on Rails") from [Substance Lab](http://substancelab.com "Freelance webdevelopment for startups and small/medium businesses").
