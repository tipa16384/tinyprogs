# Star Trek Online: This is your Federation News Service

It took a lot of waiting around, but on this stardate, the Federation News Service (thanks, Ark, for the awesome name suggestion!) became the latest fleet to roam the space lanes, seeking out new adventures and stories and so on....

Now that we have a fleet, maybe it's possible to get enough people to do the raidisodes?

If you'd like to become a part of the Federation News Service in Star Trek Online, hunt up one of the senior editors -- @Caylinn, @BlueKae, @Tipa, @Vannikar, @khaaaaaaan!, @Aurangzeb or @camenecium -- for an invite!

Kae looks a bit like a mix of Mr. Fantastic and Mystique. Never noticed that he has such long legs except on this screenshot! :)

So many pretty female tac officers! I am in love! I just need them on my bridge. The man with the black head next to Tipa also looks quite awesome. I fear one of them will have to change his/her career for an engineering position. A am running out of officer slots! :)
