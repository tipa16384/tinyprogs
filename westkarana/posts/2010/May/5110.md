# Wizard101: Ambrose flees the spiral, leaves cryptic recording

*Posted by Tipa on 2010-05-05 19:37:13*

Students and faculty alike were shocked this afternoon when Merle Ambrose, Headmaster of Wizard City's prestigious Ravenwood Academy, left the Spiral and led police on a merry chase through the streets of Austin. 

He left behind a cryptic recording. Close friends Gamma and Bartleby have refused to comment. Austin commuters report a second person in the car with the headmaster; descriptions match that of villain Malistaire Drake's long dead wife, Sylvia. If the reports are correct, Sylvia Drake's death may have been faked.

Repeat: Headmaster Ambrose has left the Spiral....
