# Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning: The Screenshots

*Posted by Tipa on 2010-12-15 19:19:48*

If I were online media, I'd never have been able to bring you these exclusive screenshots from Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning that the Big Huge Games division of 38 Studios is busily polishing down in Baltimore. But since it's just you and me, here, Curt sent these along with a personal message about the hard work the super secret Copernicus guys are doing.

Here's another secret wallpaper:

First reaction: these screenshots are so DARK! I know from the teaser video that the whole game isn't dark like this, but I'd appreciate seeing a scene with more brightness. Because I have DDO for my game where everything is so friggin' dark all the time that I have to tie a rope around my hireling and toss her ahead of me so I know where the walls are.

Here's what Curt had to say to me in his personal letter to me, and me only:


> To ~~38 Studios' Friends and Fans~~ **Tipa**, 

I hope this email finds you enjoying the holiday season. We are hard at work in Baltimore on Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning™ and in Boston on Project Copernicus, and we look forward to unveiling Reckoning at a host of shows and events in 2011.

This newsletter is one of the ways we will reach out to you, our most dedicated fans, with the latest news and sneak peeks. With that in mind, we wanted to give you a holiday gift: two desktop wallpapers. These never-before-seen, in-game images are from Reckoning. *We’ll eventually share them with the online and print media*, but we thought you should see them first!

Happy holidays to you and yours,
Curt Schilling
Chairman/Founder, 38 Studios



In Boston? Is that [Boston, Rhode Island](http://38studios.com/press-release/38-studios-announces-providence-ri-its-new-headquarters-location)?

**TheRemedy** writes: My simple brain is exploding in confusion right now. I mean you have to realize it's Amalur right? It's all over your blog so how could you not know. I just wish I was in on the Alura joke but the only reference on google is Supergirl's mom.

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: Sigh. No, it's ME BEING STUPID. I don't know WHY I keep confusing those names. Sorry. Fixed :(

**TheRemedy** writes: To be fair, Amalur is a dumb sounding name and you should get on your direct line to Curt Schilling and R.A. Salvatore and have it changed to Alura.
