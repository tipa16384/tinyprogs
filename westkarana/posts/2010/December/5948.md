Plant a tree for charity! KingsIsle is using its new Gardening system as an innovative way to give to local children's charities. Simply buy a Giving Tree seed in its cash shop, plant it, and harvest the unique rewards while helping kids in need.
 

> Give the Gift of Magic with this Giving Tree!

Last year our players raised $125,000 for Charity! This year, we are offering our players a chance to give a little Magic to someone in need. 

When you purchase of a Giving Tree Seed from the Crowns Shop at the price of 2500 Crowns (approximately $5), KingsIsle Entertainment will donate the net proceeds to two charities in Texas.
