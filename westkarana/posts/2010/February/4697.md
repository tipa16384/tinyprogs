# Star Trek Online vs EVE Online, Part 4

*Posted by Tipa on 2010-02-14 15:13:04*

The survivors of the destruction of the USS Alvarado had discovered scantily-clad native girls along with an ancient wreck of what appeared to be a Starfleet vessel. Putting that mystery aside, the crew got busy, their work cut out for them.

Parts 2-4 were originally one really long comic. I split it into three parts and added a little more to make it easier to read. Next stop for the STO crew: Jita. There is no way they can prepare themselves for the mercantile capital of New Eden.

I think that must've happened to every EVE player at least a couple times =)

Plus the warp out without retrieving my drones, and buying something cheap on the market without realizing its in a nearby low-sec station.
