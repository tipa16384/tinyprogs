# Wizard101: Who are the mysterious Celestians?

KingsIsle today released a mysterious screenshot of some of the folks we'll be meeting when we journey to the undersea realm of Celestia this summer. They promise to reveal some of the darkened characters little by little as the day approaches, but we here at West Karana have a pretty good idea what we'll find.

In the background we clearly see the majestic [Space Carrier Blue Noah](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1No7kLb2dow), protecting Earth from dangers both in space and under the water. Inside the glass dome, you can see a Farmville crane constructing a Pumpkin Hatchery, so there's anime, space/water warfare and super popular social gaming, all in one shot. The characters appear be facing a photographer who would be outside the dome, indicating a species of water-dwelling portrait artists, clearly a reference to the precinct sketch artist in [Fish Police](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6D5C1C7Nso).

Indie comics? Nice going, KI.

On to the blackened folks themselves.

On the left, you have a Fiddler Crab with his one huge claw. Sounds like a bard class? Finally, I say. Next over seems to be a hermit crab, next is, I dunno, a robot crab.

The tall guy in the center is carrying a lantern and a sheathed sword. The girl behind him has freakishly large hands, and at their feet is Togepi from Pokemon. I imagine these three represent the new Astral magic in some manner.

Continuing rightward is Robby the Other Robot Crab, a huge crab holding a Hokusai print, and Spongebob Squarepants.

How'd I do? Did my guesses jibe with yours? I guess we'll find out in the weeks to come :)

* note: original picture may not necessarily feature Spongebob Squarepants.

** looking at the picture further, the guy with the lantern looks to be wearing a uniform. If I had to guess, I'd say he was wearing a hat like the Confederate uniform and had a huge mustache, and his sword would be an officer's sabre as is still used ceremonially in the Marines.

## Comments!

One of my friends, has been wanting to try one, but I need to suggest a game that has basic quests, but is still fun, colorful, and immersive. I was hoping you could help me out! Thanks!
