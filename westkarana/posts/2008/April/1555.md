# Nostalgia the Guild recruiting!

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-04-21 13:24:29*

Hey! It's not too late to get in on one last romp through Norrath before it all blowed up! We're looking for a druid, cleric, berserker, monk or beastlord to fill out a second group. Check us out at [Nostalgia the Guild the Website](http://nostalgia.chasingdings.com)!

Requirements: EverQuest expansions up through The Buried Sea, an ability to play Friday nights at 7PM Eastern time on a regular basis, and a desire to experience EQ1 with friends as it was meant to be seen. We have a Vent server and SOE willing, may soon even have a guild :)

Leave a message on the website if you're interested. We're currently between levels 10 and 15, so there is no problem catching up.

You can just make a character, join the guild and just stop by once in awhile, group with us when we're just goofing off between the group nights. You don't have to make any sort of commitment aside from being a nice person. However, if you WOULD want to join the progression group, well, of course we'd be overjoyed.

And I only ever tried playing EQ for a couple of months (and gave up on it because there was nobody around at low levels to group with), so it would be almost all new and exciting.

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: We have two solid groups so far and working on a third. One day a week is all we play officially, though actually the members generally play more than that. We have a strict limit on how much people level so nobody gets left behind. Come on by!

I just ran across this post. I've been getting really bored with WoW again and would be interested in joining.

What level are you guys, and is it too late to join the fun?

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: We have a new group starting Tuesday that is level 10 -- the level the tutorial is done with you. The main progression is at 20-25, and not too hard to catch up to that. We are quite deliberately moving slowly.
