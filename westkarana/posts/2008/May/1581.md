# Vanguard Game Update 5 preview!

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-05-06 09:27:44*

![Telon traffic jam](http://www.massively.com/media/2008/05/vgclient-2008-05-01-18-36-02-20.jpg)

Last Thursday I did a huge interview with Vanguard developer Lenny "Tiraslee" Gullo, and as well as talking a LOT about the upcoming VG game update, he let me play with a lot of the new mounts and showed off some of the new spell graphics.

Well, after wrangling with Windows Movie Maker for a few days (the heat of a thousand exploding stars cannot come close to my frustration at that program's limitations, but at least it's free), I finally finished putting it in some sort of shape, and it's being rolled out on Massively in three parts today.

The first post, where we show off the new mounts, [is up now](http://www.massively.com/2008/05/06/exclusive-vanguard-game-update-5-preview/). Later today is a spell effects video, and this afternoon is the mega-interview where a lot of information about the quests to get the mounts is revealed... as well as other neat stuff.

[Check it out](http://www.massively.com/2008/05/06/exclusive-vanguard-game-update-5-preview/)! And let me know if you liked the videos... or if you have any suggestions for better cheap (or free) video editing software that can deal with the Fraps codec and 1680x1050 video.

## Comments!

At $99, it's not free it's not too pricey either.
Yet for the price it's got some very good features and is super simple to use.

Hope that helps and keep up the great work!

A lot of my clips were in the 4 gigabyte range and that just broke WMM to pieces; I had to use another program to re-encode all the clips and also reduce their size and frame rate so WMM would work with them... working with HUGE clips is what I need most from the thing!

As you know, Fraps automatically breaks them into 3+GB chunks.
The editor handled them perfectly fine and I only had 2gb of mem and a Athlon x2 at the time mind you.
So long as your machine is anywhere near current you should be ok.

Speaking of videos my AOC writeup is done with 4 in game videos taken by me. Cheers.

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: Camtasia? I'll have to look at that. I can afford a modest amount. I just can't pay Adobe Premier prices.

**[Captain Angry](http://www.captain-angry.com)** writes: Camtasia studio is $300. :P

Its as easy to use as WMM and doesn't have many more production features but it has vastly superior output capability.

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: One thing WMM has which I think would be cool if I could get it to work, is AutoMovie. It analyzes your movie and your audio track(s), finds the best bits somehow and speeds you from one good bit to another.

It hasn't worked for me yet... and I doubt it can do a proper job... but if I ever get AutoMovie working, I'll post something about it. Maybe my sister's wedding...

**[Captain Angry](http://www.captain-angry.com)** writes: That sounds a bit like [Animoto](http://animoto.com/?ref=bdyxiwnl). but I think it only uses photos and short videos. It still comes up with nice production values. My brother showed it to me and I made a real quick thing with some images I had on my PC: http://animoto.com/play/Xa7HUQcS9Cd5eQkjK4W07A

**[almagill](http://lolnuns.com)** writes: Tipa, shop around and you should be able to get Adobe Premier Elements at a decent price. Can usually find it bundled with Photoshop Elements for ~£70 here, so similar in $s? It's not *full* featured but if you're using Windows Movie Maker it's a world ahead.

If I was on the right machine I could check if it handles the screen res you mentioned but it's late o'clock here and I'm tired / lazy ;)

I use it along with Fraps for most everything now.

**Wrapye** writes: It has been a long, long time since I logged into VG (I think I have a level 5 Wolven Shadowknight), and the graphics for both boar-based mounts are part of the reason why. Do they blindfold their artists, so as to be able to claim to have zen artists or such? Guh.
