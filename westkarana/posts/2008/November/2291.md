# I feel your pain.

World of Warcraft is a name of power. It summons spam blogscrapers from the mist-filled depths where they lurk, waiting for someone of the mortal world to summon them forth. World of Warcraft. Their noses twitch, their ghastly bone spines quiver, the hunt begins.

I feel most sorry for the WoW bloggers who have to deal with them every hour of every day.

Edge, count yourself lucky. Maybe Blogger stops them. Maybe if Wordpress hosted this blog, they'd stop them for me. I'm just happy that Akismet catches most of them, but a couple have gotten through.
