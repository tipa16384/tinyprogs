# Spellborn soundscape

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-11-01 16:16:16*

Saw this on [WarCry](http://www.warcry.com/news/view/87141-Chronicles-of-Spellborn-Hawksmouth-Soundscapes); it's a video of the shard of Hawksmouth in Spellborn with the ambient sound and music going. It's... strangely relaxing. The streets they show are streets I'd like to walk down. The whole thing reminds me a lot of Baldur's Gate II, but with modern, 3D graphics...

Music is so underrated in games. 

Guild Wars soundtrack is bar none a massive treat.

Conan feels bombastic.

EQ2's zones had very cool feelings, like the starting areas were light hearted and fun.

Even those first times in WoW.

Now that games are also going to "action" scene based music (EQ2, Guild Wars, Conan), where the tempo changes according to the fight...awesome.

The ambiance is lovely in this video. Can't wait to see more.

(As I repeat the mantra, "I will no longer get enthusiastic about an MMORPG until I play it, I will no longer get enthusiastic about an MMORPG until I play it, I will no longer get enthusiastic about an MMORPG until I play it)

Looking good...

I like the way Spellborn is being launched. Nobody is hammering anyone over the head with a deluge of TMI, just here and there, someone grabs your sleeve and says, 'Hey, check this out!'
