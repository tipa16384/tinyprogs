# EQ: The Attack of the Killer Bees

The plan was to go to some experience hot zone last night for Nostalgia's weekly meet-up. But Mantis decided to just farm some of the giants in the Bastion of Thunder while waiting, and then I drifted over there -- again, just while waiting for everyone else to log in. Coldheat came over after a few and, while waiting, each of us with our bots to make a full group (ranger, enchanter, two clerics, two warriors), we cleared out the water wing, killed the wing boss (grats Coldheat on some nice Defiant shoulders), stepped on the teleport pad and found that the bees -- the Stormriders -- were uncamped!

The Stormriders are lower level than pretty much anything else in BoT. But, they have nearly no hit points, can be chain pulled with no delay, and drop decent cash loot. You can kill two or three bees in the time it takes to kill one giant and pull another. Best camp in the zone :)

Sejal was having computer problems, Niiko had real-life stuff come up, our druid was off in LBP-land and our paladin was off in... well, another server.

This is the exciting news.

Mantis has a pally friend from his old server who is going to transfer and join Nostalgia this week! That is SO EXCITING! With a real tank, we can start thinking about raiding once more, or perhaps just finishing up the Dragons of Norrath faction quests and heading into there.

We're ALMOST up to Omens of War level, which means Wall of Slaughter, which means Epic 1.5s. But before we do that, we have to do our Epic 1.0s. You don't HAVE to have the 1.0 to do the 1.5, but it makes it a lot easier.

Coldheat is, from what I understand, up to the Ixiblat Fer fight in Burning Woods. This isn't the end of the quest; he still, at least, has to make a trip into Sol B and gather four Pearlescent Fragments from Skyfire, but it's close. I'd love to be able to finish up his epic really soon.

We discussed last night our leveling, and I think the consensus was that we would keep leveling at least until 70. The encompasses expansions up through Dragons of Norrath and would leave us at a good place for earning AAs -- the Plane of Earth -- as well as several places inside OoW, like the Muramite Proving Ground and Riftseeker's Sanctum. We desperately need AAs.

Leveling: I am now 40% through level 63. Coldheat dinged 62 (and grats on the couple of Spectral Parchments you earned). Not sure if Mantis was 64 before we started or if he dinged there, but that's where he is now. Mantis' palading friend is, I think, 67, and Niiko is 66, so some of us have some catching up to do. We'll meet at 70.

Which, of course, as it must, brings up the possibility of transferring the Original Tipa, my 70 rogue who is mostly Gates of Discord-geared but without her Epic 1.5, to Luclin. I love my ranger and I love being able to tank and pull and track, but I do miss the rogue... and her 400 AAs. With a paladin to tank and a bard to pull, though... well, I'll see how things work out at 70.
