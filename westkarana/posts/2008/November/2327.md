# ShutterCal?

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-11-25 21:18:19*

Anski at [Always Go Right](http://alwaysgoright.com/) blog [wrote today about ShutterCal](http://alwaysgoright.com/2008/11/shuttercal-your-life-in-photos/), a new social site. In this one, you take a picture every day, and post it on an online calendar. Plenty of people doing this on Flickr, but similar to NaNoWriMo, this one subtly nags you to take and post a picture.

I'm not totally sold on the idea, but [I thought I would give it a try](http://shuttercal.com/calendar/Tipa/). Just yesterday and today so far.

Game related? Nah. Just real life. But sometimes, Real Life is good, too.

Hopefully I'll actually get some updates in. We'll see how it goes! I should be better about taking pictures. I always slack.
