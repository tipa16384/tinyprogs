# Arthur C. Clarke, Dead at 90

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-03-18 19:39:46*

[Arthur C. Clarke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke), grandmaster author of some of the greatest science fiction ever written and inventor of the [geosynchronous communication satellite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosynchronous_orbit), [is dead today](http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-clarke19mar19,0,393161.story).

He's one of the last from SF's Golden Age. He worked with Stanley Kubrick, to turn his short story, *Sentinel*, into the movie (and accompanying book), *2001: A Space Odyssey*.

Without question, he will be missed.

I've been a fan of his from my earliest discoveries of written science fiction. His light-hearted stories of tall tales told in a bar (many collected in *Tales of the White Hart* would later inspire such famed writers as Larry Niven and Spider Robinson. His book *Childhood's End*, to be made at some point into a movie, was an obvious inspiration to such invasion epics as *V* and *Independence Day*, and was one of the first books which discussed the next stage of human evolution might bring, and what the effect on those of us left behind might be. *Imperial Earth* inspired in me a love of puzzles which is still with me today.

The world has lost one of its greatest thinkers and inspirations today.

Farewell...
