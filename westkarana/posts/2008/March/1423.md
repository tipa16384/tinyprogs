# Gary Gygax, R.I.P.

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-03-04 14:14:40*

Via [Zen of Design](http://www.zenofdesign.com/?p=1019), the sad news that Gary Gygax, the father of modern roleplaying games and the **co-**creator of Dungeons & Dragons, [has passed away](http://www.freeyabb.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=4373&mforum=trolllordgames).

He gathered together the ideas in a dozen or more fantasy books and showed us all how we could live our own adventures in those worlds.

The RPG and MMO industries owe him an incalculable debt. Without D&D, we'd all be doing something different right now.

See ya on the Astral Plane.

He had such a wide impact on gaming that resounds even today in our favorite MMORPGs and such an impact on hundreds of thousands of gamers who came of age in the seventies and eighties playing D&D. I remember going down to the "hobby shop" (do they have them anymore?) once a week to buy a new D&D module. He wrote many of them. I remember reading them as if they were novels--even if I never got around to playing them.

I'd bought the original set and tried to play it with my sister, but I didn't really understand how important imagination was part of the game. When I started at UNH, I was going to that day where the school clubs and organizations recruited new students, and I was astounded to see... gamers... gaming. I asked if they had ever heard of Dungeons & Dragons, and they had, and I joined, and that was when I knew games -- specifically, role playing games -- would be with me all my life.
