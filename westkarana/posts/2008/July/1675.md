# Chrono Trigger for the DS?

Over at DS Fanboy, they have an article hinting that Chrono Trigger -- one of the SNES' best RPGs -- [could be making the jump to the Nintendo DS](http://www.dsfanboy.com/2008/07/02/chrono-trigger-ds-for-real/).

This would be fantastic. Especially if they don't repeat the mistakes of the FF3 port. Having to zoom in and out all the time combined with unreadably (to me) small text made that game frustrating instead of enjoyable. I have to admit I would be far more excited if they announced Chrono Trigger for the Wii Virtual Console.

I suppose I COULD dig up my SNES and plug it in... but with the PS2, PS3 and Wii there already, it's getting kind of crowded.

**Mallika** writes: I hope so too. Waiting another year or two for localization would be a downer.

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: Just won't be the same if I'm not sitting on the couch, playing it on the TV. Text-heavy adventure games don't work well for me on the DS.

Of course, when I see news like this what I'm really hoping for is a return to Xenogears...
