# Sigh. Rock Band 2 set list.

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-07-14 21:21:05*

I wonder how I ever thought I would get out of buying Rock Band 2.

[No such luck](http://www.joystiq.com/2008/07/14/rock-band-2-on-disc-track-list-revealed-features-over-80-songs/). That set list ROCKS.

Reserve my copy now, I guess....

Good lord, 84 songs on the disc and all masters. I guess I've got to go put 5 down myself.

Looks like it's gonna be GHWT for me and my Wii.

Stop that rhyming and I mean it!

Anybody want a peanut?

Bildo hit the nail on the head, 84 songs on a $60 game (if you already own RB1 instruments) thats under $1 a song. Deal me in.

On the plus side, there is Jethro Tull, Kansas and Dream Theater

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: Yeah. Veterans of Psychic Wars or Astronomy would have been indescribably awesome. Though I did like Cities on Flame on GH3, was surprised to not see their "other" hit, since they already had Godzilla and Don't Fear (the Reaper). So where's "Burnin' for You"?

**[Snafzg](http://thegreenskin.com)** writes: Dear god... this is going to ROCK! I hear GH4 is bringing in the "band" approach... I guess we'll see which one has the better songs, because even though GH has had some great ones, the RB2 setlist will be very hard to top (especially if you get all the RB1 stuff too).

I may fork out for a next gen console for this game alone... Hopefully, they can get it working for PS3, because that's my preference atm.

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: From what I understand, RB is identical on the Xbox and the PS3. Probably RB2, as well. Problem is, my son's Xbox will be heading to college this fall with him, and all my RB DLC will be locked up inside, with no way of getting it to my PS3. I need to get my DLC FROM there, TO here, and also get them to convert the RB1 songs from the Xbox 360 RB and put them on my PS3.

Maybe I can just rent RB for the PS3 and do the conversion...

**TheRemedy** writes: If they allow this conversion I don't see why you couldn't do that. Though, that wouldn't be best for them as a business to be basically selling their previous game for 5 dollars. Personally I think we'll be seeing Rock Band 1 songs as dlc packs when Rock Band 3 or 4 comes out.
