# Finally DRM-free: John Cage's most famous opus, 4'33"

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-01-11 14:14:13*

With the news that Sony BMG is dropping DRM from its music and as that final, disgraceful era comes to an end, it's time to fill out my collection.

*David Tudor plays John Cage's 4'33" in Concert*

While the end of restrictions on how and where you play the music you purchase digitally is in sight, there's still a real need to take the last hundred years of so of recorded music and get it into online stores so we can buy it! Some of the [most important works of the 20th century](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4'33%22) still have not gotten the exposure they deserve.

I usually don't care much for custom ringtones, but I'd buy this one in an instant.

I'm kinda sad that that dream remains a dream. The only recording of this work I could find on Amazon was a [15 minute extended dance remix](http://www.amazon.com/1500-433-Extended-Dance-Mix/dp/B000S4QCBE/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&s=dmusic&qid=1200073111&sr=1-11) of 4'33", and considering that was off an album called "Necessity is the M*f*r of Invention", it was probably a remix of Frank Zappa's recording of it on the "A Chance Operation: A John Cage Tribute" album.

You can buy Zappa's recording of it, by the way, from eMusic, which splits it into [fivedifferent movements](http://www.emusic.com/album/Various-Artists-KOCH-Records-John-Cage-A-Chance-Operation-MP3-Download/10607012.html) you must buy separately, which I feel is a little unusual and probably jarring, since the original piece has only three movements.

Amazon [does sell the entire tribute album](http://www.amazon.com/Chance-Operation-John-Cage-Tribute/dp/B000001SH6) including the full opus in dead plastic form, but finding it digitally as one piece? Not yet. Hopefully soon.

Until then, I guess I'll just plant these earbuds in my ears and hum it to myself.

Starting... NOW.
