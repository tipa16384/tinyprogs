# EQ2: GU49 live!

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-10-07 12:25:01*

Via Taymar at [MMORPG Info](http://www.mmorpg-info.org/) (always a fantastic place for information about EQ2 and other games), EQ2's game update 49 -- the last one before the expansion -- is live. GU49 introduces guild halls, multicore support, and more. Perhaps another chapter in the Anashti Sul world event?

I THOUGHT they were doing a tailoring update with new colors and patterns, but I can't remember if that was expansion or pre-expansion.

My tests with the multicore support on my Core 2 Duo-powered laptop showed a significant improvement on Test.

I'm just rushing over to read the EQ write-up - no more corpse runs? I thought the graveyards were a perfect compromise :(
