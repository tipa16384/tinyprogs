# W101: Update to the October 1 Update

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-10-01 16:27:46*

Professor Grayrose [added something new to the patch notes](https://www.wizard101.com/site/posts/list/2144.ftl):


> I forgot to add something! 

You will find a new setting in your Options panel under "Show Names". 
The selections are now 
Everyone 
None 
Players 
Non Players 
All Others 

This will allow you to only see everyone that is not a player, such as creatures, shopkeeps and items. 

Yay! 




Very useful. I usually go with names OFF when I am in public spaces. You kind of need them ON to see the primary schools of the monsters you battle -- and this is the best of both worlds.
