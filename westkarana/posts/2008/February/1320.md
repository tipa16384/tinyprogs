# EQ2: Nice while it lasted -- Clan of Shadows declines the haffer

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-02-05 01:45:49*

![everquest2-2008-02-04-21-24-16-85.jpg](../../../uploads/2008/02/everquest2-2008-02-04-21-24-16-85.jpg)

After a month, the large portion of which was spent waiting outside raid zones or off playing alts or other games rather than just wait around, Clan of Shadows decided it didn't really need another troubador after all. Wasn't any real surprise. I'd been expecting it ever since we they hit Veeshan's Peak. It's a shame, I'm not happy about it. They were great people and I was really good friends with a lot of them. They gave me the option of sticking around for another two weeks for another vote, and maybe even two more weeks after that for a third, but that's kind of desperate. I don't know if I could really take another month waiting outside Veeshan's Peak, maybe occasionally coming in to help clear trash until the real raiders showed up, hoping to somehow convince people I was worth having around.

I was depressed after. I didn't know what to do. The guild was so *right*, everything I wanted. The right times, the right balance between grouping and raiding, and of course, they were excellent at raiding as well. Oh well, so it goes. Good luck to them, and anyone need a 80 troubador, flagged for Veeshan's Peak? Or an 80 heavily armored battle cleric? :)

I'd left Revolution about a year ago, I guess, when the guild leader went AFK and I had a chance with Eternal Chaos. The leader has just come back and I asked for an invite back and he let me back. Revo is a PST guild so it's not a place I can stay, but at least there's friendly voices in guild chat. I hate playing by myself! I joined a random pickup group and did CoA and Chelsith, but ya know, it was a lot more fun with CoS peeps.

Guess I'll get over it. Wish I hadn't donated those four masters to the guild. In retrospect, I should have held on to them until I was made full member.

I came to EQ2 adamant I would not join a guild for the reasons of previous guild "drama's", "issues" etc. 
All I can think of is being in a guild requires a hardcore player...who is on everyday for 3 hours minimum, but more preferred...which as an adult, with a family and responsibilities...does not work.
As well, that player has to follow rules set by some person within that guild..and do those rules follow your lifestyle?
Almost makes me not want to play an MMO...just to do without the issues..

But, I like the social aspect....So, here I sit with my own guild...and hopefully trying to please everyone...and it will not happen. I can see it. So, I may have a guild, it may become empty...but, I will at least be happy with the game until another game comes along that is as good as EQ2....and then the guild debate can start all over again...lol

Later and cheer up

You know my long list of unsatisfactory guild issues, so you know I can understand. Especially with the troubador. It's a shame you had to sit out so often, but hey, at least you're flagged.

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: I just really like both raiding and grouping, and this was the first guild I'd found that emphasized both :P I don't think any of the other top raiding guilds on the server are looking for anyone. There was one guild, I think it was Commorient Kindred, who, according to their recruiting tab, were looking for both a troubador and an inquisitor, but I don't know very much about them. After Revolution, Eternal Chaos and Clan of Shadows in one year, I'm a little paranoid about joining any more guilds unless I'm absolutely sure there's a match before I even consider them. I come from the EQ1 philosophy, where you find your home and then you stick with them for the rest of your gaming life.

That recruiting tab, by the way, is such a cool tool that I have never seen elsewhere. EQ1 had a looking for guild tool but it was *nothing* like the recruiting tab.

**Zygwen** writes: I think you should have stuck it out with us a little longer. Things can be very laissez faire in CoS which is great when it comes to grouping but sucks when it comes time to get people to vote on recruits. A swing of 3 votes would have been enough for you to pass the second vote. Maybe it will make some guild members wake up and get off their asses but I doubt it.

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: I would have definitely stuck it out, just in case things went differently -- and I got a bunch of tells from people who weren't aware that my vote was up so perhaps it could have been different -- but honestly, I was getting less and less excited about the prospect of more endless nights sitting outside raid zones. And of course, there being a fair number of people who felt I was not a good fit for the guild. Based on your numbers and assuming 24 people voted, I would have gotten 15 yes votes and fully 9 no votes. And fewer total votes make that ratio even worse, but from this side of the divide, it looks like my vote wasn't even close -- a clear mandate to have me look elsewhere.

I do thank you and all of CoS for the opportunity to be part of such a great group of players, if only for a little while.

Having been guilded with you before I remember what an asset you could be to a guild. I sure hope that you land on your feet, guildwise, very soon. 

If you don't, who can I raid vicariously through?

Seriously, I hope you find a good fit soon.

**Kirena** writes: It's an absolute shame in my opinion. You were hardly given enough raid time with us. I'm personally quite disappointed in our leaders/officers for that. We've had recruits that haven't given or brought the guild much of anything but a lot of verbal hot air. You are an outstanding player. I admire people like yourself who really know their character(s) and the game. I'm sorry for the few percent who couldn't see that.

Best of luck to you Dina. It was a pleasure and honor to have you as a guildmate.

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: Thanks, Kirena :) I'll miss you guys.

**Runaf** writes: Sorry to hear you've moved on, but I think I see where you're coming from. With a guild our size, rotations can always be a problem, especially in difficult zones like VP. Hope you don't feel overlooked, it's unfortunate it ended up like that.

That aside, hope to see more of Liz Strickland, we could always use a good Freetrader :)

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: I absolutely cannot play EQ1 any more. I would LIKE to have that kind of time and devotion again, but it, along with WoW, are soul sucking games, and after so many years playing both games, I haven't got much soul left. Just the thought of having to level to 80 and do all that horrible, horrible factioning in that icy zone in Serpent's Spine makes it impossible to return. I've done my last six hour LFG, thanks.

I think you all should come to EQ2. So there :P

@Runaf, well, someday CoS may need a troubador, and then you can bet I'll be right there applying for it. So you might not have seen the last of me yet -- and of course I'll be in PotBS :)

**Allegro** writes: If there's an opening in Commerient Kindred, Dina might want to try it - I know they'd appreciate Dina's skills. They are, for the most part, good people, but like many guilds in EQ2 have a high turnover of players, so folks I knew from a year ago are probably gone. CK and CoS share a goal of raiding for fun - let the big hardcore guilds go for server-first and all that - we'll get there when we get there type-attitude. And for someone like me, who clings to her soul (and her sanity) after trying a hardcore guild, it's that attitude that makes EQ2 so playable.

**[Richard "Pocky" Kim](http://www.richard-kim.com/)** writes: I'm sorry that the guild you applied to turned you down. While I don't know you beyond your writings, you seem like a good person to have in a guild. I personally have never been fond of the 'you have to be voted in' system of guild-ing, but then again, I'm also burned out on raiding and 'hard core'-ness.

I can understand being kind of burned out on going back to old games, though - I have friends trying to get me back into FFXI, EQ2, and other MMOs. I'm back to WoW, thanks to an invite by a good RL friend, and I think I've found my 'home', finally.

Good luck in all of your endeavors! ^\_^ I'll keep my fingers crossed!

**Earnest Dodge** writes: The whole process of requiring members to vote apps in, but not requiring members to vote at all seems a little half-assed and self-dooming. This would never work in either of the guilds I've been in!

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: Earnest -- I agree. People who have something negative to say will be inspired to get that no vote out, but people who are indifferent or positive might just assume other people will take care of it without them having to be involved. My old EQ1 guild worked slightly differently, and I was an officer there for many years so I had insight into it.

First, the officers voted on a candidate. This was mandatory. We had between nine and eleven officers representing the different classes, and three "nos" meant they were out. In the rare event of a tie, the guild leader broke the tie.

If the candidate passed that, then we took a membership vote, which was optional, though we hoped people would weigh in. We would have the names of the candidates up for consideration in the guild MotD, how many days left for votes and so on. But the membership vote would be advisory. If there were strong negative feelings, the officers would take that into account and try to discern the reason for it. If they were valid, then the candidate probably wouldn't get in unless they had other reasons to stay -- like, high attendance and skilled play could make up for being a bit of a jerk.

Every candidate was dealt with as an individual -- there was no purely mathematical rule. We had a stringent application process, so usually, if we decided to trial a person and give them the guild tag, we expected they would be a good fit for the guild.

It was our rule that we would never turn away a good player, no matter what their class, because turnover is a constant for every guild and we wanted the best. People would drift off and stop playing, lose interest, change mains, leave for more hardcore or more casual guilds, change servers to be with friends, etc.

We filled raids on a first-come, first-serve basis, though we would swap people as needed to ensure a good raid. This inspired people to show up on time :)

Of course, EQ1 had larger raids -- unlimited at the start (bring 200 people to kill Naggy? Why not?!?), then 72, then 54 with a smattering of smaller raids, so we had more spots to keep filled.

EQ1 guilds were extremely organized. EQ2 guilds seem to get by with less organization.
