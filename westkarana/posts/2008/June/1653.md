# Project Powder addendum

Instead of racing, you see who can gather the most good coins while avoiding bad coins. When I got 5 and went to get my new licenses, the whole license board just hung the game. A GM was trying to get an event of some sort going, but the room kept being disconnected. So I went shopping, got some new pants, gloves, and some earmuffs, then tried out the one new license I was able to get in a few quick races.

It's still quite buggy, but you'd expect that in a closed bera. We had to repatch twice tonight. Quick, arcade-y, multiplayer fun.

Anyway, look for me and my "!n00b ctb ftw" hoodie in open beta.
