On the way to the EQ2 expansion panel, stopped by the room to upload some pics.

Attended the Living Legacy feedback panel, more notes later, but it sounds like it or something like it will be coming in the future, perhaps as soon as the tenth anniversary celebration next spring. A new progression server is a possibility (for EQ).

Talked with a guy from Matrox for awhile, angered some VG players, and ate lunch at Quarks.More later!

Oh yes, Kirk-bear and Picard-bear are now mine.

They said the response to the last two progression servers was phenomenal.

I left Quark's with only Kirk Bear and Janeway Bear (pictured).

Yeah, I know it could be Sisco Bear, but that would just be weird. Kirk and Sisco? I don't think so.
