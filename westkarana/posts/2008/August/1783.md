# Where is SPELLBORN already?

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-08-06 13:46:47*

My constant trolling over on the [Chronicles of Spellborn](http://tcos.com) forums have as yet revealed no news about any North American release. They are supposed to be on the verge of open beta, and to have signed a letter of intent months ago with an unnamed US publisher (my guess, again: [Aeria Games](http://aeriagames.com)).

However, the Spellborn computer they collaborated with German PC makers Ultraforce on earlier this year, [they are now releasing case-only](http://tcos.com/sbforum/viewtopic.php?t=13769), in case you're not jazzed about the computer they had, but loved their case. 249 Euros, so US$384, probably closer to US$500 when all shipping and customs fees are paid, which is pretty expensive just for a case. Just not worth it to buy things from Europe when you live in the US any more.

Now, even allowing for language issues, I'm still putting this one on the list with Hero's Journey and Darkfall. I will believe it when I see it on the shelf at Fry's.

The graphics throw me off ( I like my characters to look "awesome" and "realistic")...but, who knows, until I see it.

Ah well, until I hear more, I just try not to think about it

Cheers

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: Acclaim??? Okay, that came out of nowhere.

Out of all the MMO importers in the US, I think Acclaim is the least known. It was only on my radar for the David Perry thing.

Well, good, I'm glad we have a real name for it. Now, from what I understand, all they have to do is put the fun in.

Thanks for the heads-up :)
