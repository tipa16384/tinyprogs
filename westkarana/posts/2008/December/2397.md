You think you're strong. You think you can play the game without using RMT. Gonna game Aeria, gonna take all their stuff and give nothing back, cuz FREE means FREE, dunnit?

Then they come out and say they will give you THREE MONTHS of double experience, starting when you give the word... PLUS a MECHA COSTUME... if you buy that potion between this noon and the next.

OMG. EVIL.

There you have it. (Am I shilling for Aeria? Not unless they pay me!)

If Free Realms takes off, SOE is gonna make a mint on stuff like this. I hope they spring for a decent marketing effort. SOE games are so incredibly stealth. Plus, they're really late to market for games like this...

I thought it would be cute for a couple of days simply because of the magic and HP-like atmosphere. However, if it was more wide open and I could decorate my room, hang out more and explore, I'd very very satisfied. So now I have to consider Free Realms which was completely off my radar until now. Cartoon graphics, silly things to do, outrageous costumes, playing dress up and killing things with magic is aiight. It's as much fun as WAR but in a completely different way. It's the relax and chill MMO progression where sometimes I log on just to look at my stuff. *Smile* Yeah, I just might have to give FR a go.
