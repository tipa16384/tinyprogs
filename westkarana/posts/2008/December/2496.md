# Sorry for the outages...

Seems I exhausted my 25 GB bandwidth allotment for the month. I bought some more, but I am going to move this blog over to another host. This time for real!

I have a separate host for my guild's forums, and meant to run them side by side for awhile to see if the new one was more stable than the old one. It SEEMS to be... and anyway, I can't afford two hosts, so as soon as I can get the content moved over (and there's a lot of it -- 12 Mb just for the text content, I dunno how much for all the pictures), I'll move the domain over and, I hope, nobody will even notice the change. Except that my blog won't disappear from the face of the internet a couple of times a year.

It's also a good time to upgrade Wordpress and my theme.
