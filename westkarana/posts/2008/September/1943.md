Warhammer has public quests, and open groups!!!!

Pfft, big deal. So does Wizard 101. (Joining a friend in an instanced dungeon automatically gives you the quest for that dungeon -- *et voila*, public quests :)

/me calls up ISP to have them brace for a flood of traffic because I have mentioned Warhammer!

Warhammer!

Order or Destruction! CHOOSE YOUR SIDE AND PREPARE FOR BATTLE!

Woot! Woot! DEATH TO ALL THE VILE PEOPLE OF THE OTHER FACTION!

The irony of it all is that by the time I do get around to playing Warhammer, nobody will care anymore :)

RECONSIDER NOW!

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: My life is crazy busy right now and absolutely over the top stressful. There's no way I could keep up with the leveling everyone else would be doing, so I'm not going to frustrate myself by trying. I'd rather not play than log in for a couple of hours every other week and have to listen to everyone talk about how neat the high level stuff is. When I have a lot of free time and life has settled down, I'll try Warhammer.

I did...

And I still felt the same AFTER playing it.

So, how big IS the page count.

I heard you can DOUBLE the traffic by adding the word "Sucks" after Warhammer.

Woot!

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: My server has not been crushed under the load of page views. The worst thing about not playing a game at launch is not being part of the initial rush where everyone eagerly devours all available information about something. I know nothing about Warhammer, but I've decided: I'm not going to let that stop me.

Back in 2nd or 3rd grade, I was doing horribly in school. We had to do oral reports about various stupid stuff, so, quite naturally, I didn't bother to do it. My revelation came one day when we had to give an oral report about frogs (green, eat flies, jump, this was pre-Muppet Show so 'hosting variety shows' was still something I didn't know frogs could do). What I noticed is that everyone's oral reports were just pretty much the same.

If I just wasn't FIRST, I could just say what everyone ELSE said.

This began my string of gold stars, and a realization that has stayed with me all my life. All you have to do to succeed, is to say what everyone else says. And if you can say what everyone ELSE says, but LOUDER... well, now you're an authority.

So this night and every night for the rest of the week, I will be an authority on Warhammer Online. Tune in for the fun :)

Oh, you think my week of SPORE was bad, just wait until I get my hands on ROCK BAND 2.

I can't wait for your RvR report. Make sure to tell us how you felt about the PQ's also. I may get some RnR in and a little AFK after reading it though.
Also, I heard (well, all of the "fans" told me) that the graphics were turned on, because supposedly all the pictures were using low res textures...like this one
[WAGGHHH is right...ugh](http://lh3.ggpht.com/openedge1/SMfGrtmtRnI/AAAAAAAAD2s/bhwOWfiTKAg/s1152/screenshot_000.jpg)
But, now have all the lighting and what not, because there was no way the game would look like the screenshots on release. That's what they told me anyways.

I can't wait to hear about the evolutionary and innovative gameplay..

Thanks Tipa...you're the best
