# W101: The Gobbler King

I don't really like visiting the Gobbler King. Aside from being really stinky AND making a habit of snacking on the architecture, he is always shoving food into that maw of his and speaking with his mouth full and splattering food all over you. I know Gobblers see weight as a sign of rank and power, but isn't he fat enough?

The Gobbler King is so fat, when he jumped in the air, he got stuck. I mean, he eats a LOT. He eats so much, he has a lifeguard in his cereal bowl. I mean, he's so big, that when he goes to the movies, he sits next to EVERYONE. It's true. He weighs so much that when he stands on a scale, it says "continued on NEXT scale!". I mean, he's so fat that when he takes a bath, every toilet in Wizard City overflows. Heck, he's so big that his fleas had a revolution, and now he's known as the People's Republic of the Gobbler King.

He's a big guy.

After that unpleasantness was over, since it was getting a little late to be starting up in Krokotopia, I decided to visit Ms. Bastilla in Firecat Alley and see if she would hand me the 55 point Life wand, the troll pet or the dark fairy pet, but after half a dozen times battling her, I got three Chokers of Ferocity (gives a troll card), two Chokers of the Swarm (gives a fire crab card), and a hat.

I did level to 15 while I was there.

There's so many people who rushed through the game and are now sitting in Moo Shu waiting for Dragonspyre to come out. What's the sense in that :P

But I'm ready to move on from Wizard City.
