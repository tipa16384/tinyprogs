# Hi, latest new blog scraper

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-09-23 16:53:32*

Just a shout out to my newest reader, whom I won't name. It's another blog scraper taking my entries, which I write for my own fun and the fun of others, and trying to make money from them! And not giving me any of it! It just isn't fair!

And it sounds like my newest scraper could afford to send me some money. I sure could use it!

Anyway, if you're seeing this on a spam blog, my blog is called West Karana, and it's at ../../.., and wouldn't you rather read it without any ads?

I always try to link back to some older post, both to recycle content (doing my part to fight blogesphere warming!) and so that anybody who reads the post elsewhere will at least have some link back to its home.

Yeah, right :)

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: Well, I was press there -- I went on a press pass from Massively, and I did an article for a magazine -- but I'm not press *now*.

But if someone wants to give me free stuff, I can be bought.

And how did you find out about the scraper?

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: Scrapers often ping back, hoping that their ping will get on the blog and feed their spam blog some page rank goodness. I delete those ping-backs.

My real life is too stressful at the moment for me to do the amount of in-game time and research necessary to write EQ2 guides, which is what I was asked to write. I don't have a lot of experience writing them, as you may notice from this blog, which has none. I did write a 5000 word initial treatment on a WoW player's guide to EverQuest 2, which, since I never put it in publishable shape, was never published. I might post it here instead.
