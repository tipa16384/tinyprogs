# Disease dreams

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-09-29 08:18:27*

Whatever was sneaking up on me Friday turned into full-blown influenza Sunday morning. I've been spending my time alternately dreaming and hallucinating; I'm not sure which I'm typing this in. I want to sit up but can only do it in five minute stretches.

Two dreams I remember, but... body wants me to lie back down so they will have to wait.

I'd like to direct you to Mythokia's impressions of his [first 16 days in Singapore's National Service](http://blog.mythokia.net/2008/09/29/days-1-to-16/). It's a surreal depiction of life in what's supposed to be a giant, two year bonding exercise for all of Singapore's men.

Apparently I said some crazy stuff like, "No. The chicken is sitting in the garage and my keys are in the blender. Right Honey?!"
