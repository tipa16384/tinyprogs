# EQ2: Game update 48 is live

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-09-03 11:20:16*

[I guess I know what I'll be doing tonight](http://mmoquests.com/2008/09/03/gu48-goes-live-on-everquestii/)...

VEKSAR!

Though now that I have capped out my AAs, part of me doesn't want to finish any more quests or explore any new zones because, heck, I have 60 AAs to earn pretty soon.

But yeah...

<strong><bad>**VEKSAR!
VEKSAR!

VEKSAR was a city
I mean, it was a ruined city
or maybe it was just ruins
but it was still

VEKSAR!
VEKSAR!

Veksanating the countryside
Veksanating the iksar
Veksanating all the sarnak
And their thatch-roofed windmills

THATCH-ROOFED WINDMILLS!!!

(Wicked guitar solo)

When all of Kunark is in ruins
And every leetle thing been Veksanized
Only one city will remain
and my money is on

VEKSAR!
VEKSAR!

And the Veksar goes live to-niiiiiiight**</bad></strong>
