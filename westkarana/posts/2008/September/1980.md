# EQ: Stillmoon Temple and the Dragons of Norrath

It was another light night, but we had a cleric, warrior, ranger and enchanter and that was enough to make a group. But where?

It had been in the back of my mind that we would eventually start working on the Dragons of Norrath missions. Before you can get the missions, you need to build up faction with the one of the two wayfarer camps in Lavastorm; either the goodies or the baddies.

There's a bunch of ways to build faction -- and that's pretty important, because the whole Dragons of Norrath expansion is faction-based. Once you are amiable to your faction, you can move inside and get missions. With each new faction level, more missions open up, until the very best -- and hardest -- missions, those in "The Nest", open up, and these are the ones with the best loot, coin and experience.

But we're not there yet. We're not even inside. We had to start with the non-instanced missions, and tonight, we started in Stillmoon Temple.

Stillmoon Temple is a home of rest and contemplation for an order of goblin monks, who care for and instruct dragon hatchlings. Our job tonight: Kill them. Kill them all.

Coldheat and I, the goodies, needed to kill 20 Stillmoon creatures of any type -- pretty much everything besides the animated stone and clay sentries. Tsukiko and Mantis, the baddies, had to carve seven chunks of mottled meat from the goblins we killed. And naturally, those were uncommon drops.

Though it took awhile, it was excellent experience -- for a non-hot zone (cold zone? tepid zone?). I made two or three AAs (two more to go for Ambidexterity), Mantis came extremely close to 61, I don't know how the others did, but we all became somewhat better regarded by our wayfarer factions.

Next week, Sisca and Callendra should be back, hopefully some more folks as well. Doing faction missions is a decent way to spend a couple of hours... but there is stuff out there that is begging us to let them die!
